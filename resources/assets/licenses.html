### Turn a function into an [&#x60;http.Agent&#x60;][http.Agent] instance
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an &#x60;http.Agent&#x60; generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new &#x60;http.Agent&#x60; instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.

#### Some subclasses:

Here&#x27;s some more interesting uses of &#x60;agent-base&#x60;.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [&#x60;http-proxy-agent&#x60;][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy &#x60;http.Agent&#x60; implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [&#x60;https-proxy-agent&#x60;][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy &#x60;http.Agent&#x60; implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [&#x60;pac-proxy-agent&#x60;][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy &#x60;http.Agent&#x60; implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [&#x60;socks-proxy-agent&#x60;][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy &#x60;http.Agent&#x60; implementation for HTTP and HTTPS


Installation
------------

Install with &#x60;npm&#x60;:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; bash
$ npm install agent-base
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;


Example
-------

Here&#x27;s a minimal example that creates a new &#x60;net.Socket&#x60; connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of &#x60;agent: false&#x60; option):

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var net = require(&#x27;net&#x27;);
var tls = require(&#x27;tls&#x27;);
var url = require(&#x27;url&#x27;);
var http = require(&#x27;http&#x27;);
var agent = require(&#x27;agent-base&#x27;);

var endpoint = &#x27;http://nodejs.org/api/&#x27;;
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);

// This is the important part!
parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
  var socket;
  // &#x60;secureEndpoint&#x60; is true when using the https module
  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
    socket = tls.connect(opts);
  } else {
    socket = net.connect(opts);
  }
  return socket;
});

// Everything else works just like normal...
http.get(parsed, function (res) {
  console.log(&#x27;&#x22;response&#x22; event!&#x27;, res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Returning a Promise or using an &#x60;async&#x60; function is also supported:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
agent(async function (req, opts) {
  await sleep(1000);
  // etc&#x2026;
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Return another &#x60;http.Agent&#x60; instance to &#x22;pass through&#x22; the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
agent(function (req, opts) {
  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;


API
---

## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) &#x2192; [http.Agent][]

Creates a base &#x60;http.Agent&#x60; that will execute the callback function &#x60;callback&#x60;
for every HTTP request that it is used as the &#x60;agent&#x60; for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a &#x60;stream.Duplex&#x60; instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.

The &#x60;options&#x60; object accepts the following properties:

  * &#x60;timeout&#x60; - Number - Timeout for the &#x60;callback()&#x60; function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).

The callback function should have the following signature:

### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) &#x2192; undefined

The ClientRequest &#x60;req&#x60; can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The &#x60;options&#x60; object contains the options passed
to the &#x60;http.request()&#x60;/&#x60;https.request()&#x60; function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to &#x60;net.connect()&#x60;/&#x60;tls.connect()&#x60;, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function &#x60;cb&#x60; once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.

If the &#x60;https&#x60; module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
&#x60;secureEndpoint&#x60; property on &#x60;options&#x60; _will be set to &#x60;true&#x60;_.

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &#x22;Not a Contribution.&#x22;

      &#x22;Contributor&#x22; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &#x22;NOTICE&#x22; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#x22;AS IS&#x22; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">assert-plus</a></h4><pre class="hidden"># assert-plus

This library is a super small wrapper over node&#x27;s assert module that has two
things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
&#x60;assert.string(myArg, &#x27;myArg&#x27;)&#x60;.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
like this:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
    var assert = require(&#x27;assert-plus&#x27;);

    function fooAccount(options, callback) {
        assert.object(options, &#x27;options&#x27;);
        assert.number(options.id, &#x27;options.id&#x27;);
        assert.bool(options.isManager, &#x27;options.isManager&#x27;);
        assert.string(options.name, &#x27;options.name&#x27;);
        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, &#x27;options.email&#x27;);
        assert.func(callback, &#x27;callback&#x27;);

        // Do stuff
        callback(null, {});
    }
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

# API

All methods that *aren&#x27;t* part of node&#x27;s core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string &#x27;name&#x27; that&#x27;s not a message; &#x60;AssertionError&#x60;
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:

    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
    at Object.&#x3C;anonymous&#x3E; (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)

from:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.string(foo, &#x27;foo&#x27;);
    }
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with &#x60;Arrayof$Type&#x60;:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.arrayOfString(foo, &#x27;foo&#x27;);
    }
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

You can assert IFF an argument is not &#x60;undefined&#x60; (i.e., an optional arg):

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
    assert.optionalString(foo, &#x27;foo&#x27;);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable &#x60;NODE_NDEBUG=1&#x60;.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don&#x27;t want to pay &#x60;typeof ()&#x60; taxes to v8 in
production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from &#x60;assert&#x60; are
also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from
the &#x60;assert&#x60; module avoids this behavior.

The complete list of APIs is:

* assert.array
* assert.bool
* assert.buffer
* assert.func
* assert.number
* assert.finite
* assert.object
* assert.string
* assert.stream
* assert.date

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">ast-types-flow</a></h4><pre class="hidden"># ast-types-flow

Flow types for the Javascript AST. Based off of [benjamn/ast-types](https://github.com/benjamn/ast-types).

## Usage

First install &#x60;ast-types-flow&#x60; via npm, then you can import any of the types
that are exported.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
/* @flow */

import type {Node} from &#x27;ast-types-flow&#x27;;

function getName(node: Node): string {
  switch (node.type) {
    case &#x27;Identifier&#x27;:
      return node.name;

    case &#x27;ClassDeclaration&#x27;:
      return node.id.name; // Error, id could be null.

    case &#x27;FunctionDeclaration&#x27;:
      return node.id.name; // Fine if it&#x27;s always there.

    case &#x27;FunctionExpression&#x27;:
      if (node.id) {
        return node.id.name; // Can refine id to make sure it exists.
      } else {
        return &#x27;Unknown&#x27;;
      }

    case &#x27;Literal&#x27;:
      return node.name; // Error, Literals don&#x27;t have names, don&#x27;t be silly.
  }
  return &#x27;Unknown&#x27;;
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## How it works

A notion of &#x22;extends&#x22; is added to the Flow syntax via comments. A transform is
included that will compile the source code into useful disjoint union types
based on how the different types extend each other. For example:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
type Node = {
  common: string,
};

type Foo = {
  // extends Node
  foo: string,
};

type Bar = {
  // extends Node
  bar: number,
};
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Will be transformed into:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
type Node = {
  type: &#x27;Foo&#x27;,
  _Foo: void,
  common: string,
  foo: string,
} | {
  type: &#x27;Bar&#x27;,
  _Bar: void,
  common: string,
  bar: number,
};

type Foo = {
  type: &#x27;Foo&#x27;,
  _Foo: void,
  common: string,
  foo: string,
};

type Bar = {
  type: &#x27;Bar&#x27;,
  _Foo: void,
  common: string,
  bar: number,
};
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

A few things to note:

1. The type &#x60;Node&#x60; would more ideally be compiled into &#x60;Foo | Bar&#x60; but then the
disjoint union cannot be properly refined. For now we have to duplicate the
complete definitions.
2. Each entry in a disjoint union has to be structurally unique or Flow will
have an error on the definition. That is why the private &#x60;_Foo: void&#x60; fields
appear in the types.

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">async-each</a></h4><pre class="hidden"># async-each

No-bullshit, ultra-simple, 35-lines-of-code async parallel forEach function for JavaScript.

We don&#x27;t need junky 30K async libs. Really.

For browsers and node.js.

## Installation
* Just include async-each before your scripts.
* &#x60;npm install async-each&#x60; if you&#x2019;re using node.js.

## Usage

* &#x60;each(array, iterator, callback);&#x60; &#x2014; &#x60;Array&#x60;, &#x60;Function&#x60;, &#x60;(optional) Function&#x60;
* &#x60;iterator(item, next)&#x60; receives current item and a callback that will mark the item as done. &#x60;next&#x60; callback receives optional &#x60;error, transformedItem&#x60; arguments.
* &#x60;callback(error, transformedArray)&#x60; optionally receives first error and transformed result &#x60;Array&#x60;.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
var each = require(&#x27;async-each&#x27;);
each([&#x27;a.js&#x27;, &#x27;b.js&#x27;, &#x27;c.js&#x27;], fs.readFile, function(error, contents) {
  if (error) console.error(error);
  console.log(&#x27;Contents for a, b and c:&#x27;, contents);
});

// Alternatively in browser:
asyncEach(list, fn, callback);

      &#x22;Work&#x22; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &#x22;Derivative Works&#x22; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &#x22;Contribution&#x22; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &#x22;submitted&#x22;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &#x22;Not a Contribution.&#x22;

      &#x22;Contributor&#x22; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &#x22;NOTICE&#x22; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#x22;AS IS&#x22; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,

        Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
     become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
     distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
     this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
     distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
     Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
     Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party&#x27;s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
        its Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
     or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
     the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
     License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
     permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
     Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
     grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
     applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
     equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
     the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
     Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
     License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
     attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&#x27; rights in the Source Code
     Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
        recipients&#x27; rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
     Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
     License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
     under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
     the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
     License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
     behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
     such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
     You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
   this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
   text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
   this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
   such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
   skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
     basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
     compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
     non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
     received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
     Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
     of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
     2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an &#x22;as is&#x22; basis,
   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
   of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
   is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
   You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
   repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
   part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under
   this License except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
   such party&#x27;s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
   not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
   business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
   in this Section shall prevent a party&#x27;s ability to bring cross-claims or
   counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
   the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
      of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
      or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
      modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
      any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
      such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
      Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is
      Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of
      the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be
      attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

      This Source Code Form is subject to the
      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file,
then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a
relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a
notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - &#x22;Incompatible With Secondary Licenses&#x22; Notice

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">babel-core</a></h4><pre class="hidden">## babel-bridge

This repo holds what we&#x27;re calling a &#x22;bridge&#x22; package that is meant to ease the
transition for libraries that use &#x22;babel-core&#x22; as a peer dependency for Babel 6.

The issue with Babel 7&#x27;s transition to scopes is that if a package depends on
Babel 6, they may want to add support for Babel 7 alongside. Because Babel 7
will be released as &#x60;@babel/core&#x60; instead of &#x60;babel-core&#x60;, maintainers have
no way to do that transition without making a breaking change. e.g.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
peerDependencies: {
  &#x22;babel-core&#x22;: &#x22;6.x&#x22;
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
cannot change to

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
peerDependencies: {
  &#x22;@babel/core&#x22;: &#x22;6.x&#x22;
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

without it being a breaking change.

### Solution

To address this, we&#x27;re releasing this bridge package, to allow users to do


&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
peerDependencies: {
  &#x22;babel-core&#x22;: &#x22;6.x | ^7.0.0-bridge&#x22;
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

then where users of this package would originally have done

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;sh
npm i some-package babel-core
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

to install Babel 6, they could now do


&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;sh
npm i some-package babel-core@^7.0.0-bridge @babel/core
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

to install the bridge package, and install Babel 7&#x27;s core.

Automatically detects and sets displayName for React components. 
This is useful for having real component names show up in production builds of React apps.

Babel already does this for &#x60;React.createClass&#x60; style components, this adds support for the two other kinds of component definitions:
 * ES6-classes style components
 * Stateless components that return JSX


## Installation
Simply add &#x60;add-react-displayname&#x60; to your &#x60;.babelrc&#x60; file:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;json
{
    &#x22;plugins&#x22;: [&#x22;add-react-displayname&#x22;]
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## Troubleshooting

#### Doesn&#x27;t work for decorated classes

If you are using the &#x60;transform-decorators-legacy&#x60; plugin, make sure it&#x27;s placed *after* this plugin in your plugin list. 

## Testing

&#x60;npm test&#x60;

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">babel-plugin-transform-undefined-to-void</a></h4><pre class="hidden"># babel-plugin-transform-undefined-to-void

Some JavaScript implementations allow undefined to be overwritten, this may lead to peculiar bugs that are extremely hard to track down.

This plugin transforms &#x60;undefined&#x60; into &#x60;void 0&#x60; which returns undefined regardless of if it&#x27;s been reassigned.

## Example

**In**

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
foo === undefined;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

**Out**

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
foo === void 0;

&#x3E; Generate an AST from a string template.

In computer science, this is known as an implementation of quasiquotes.

## Install

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;sh
npm install --save-dev babel-template
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## Usage

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import template from &#x22;babel-template&#x22;;
import generate from &#x22;babel-generator&#x22;;
import * as t from &#x22;babel-types&#x22;;

const buildRequire = template(&#x60;
  var IMPORT_NAME = require(SOURCE);
&#x60;);

const ast = buildRequire({
  IMPORT_NAME: t.identifier(&#x22;myModule&#x22;),
  SOURCE: t.stringLiteral(&#x22;my-module&#x22;)
});

console.log(generate(ast).code);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const myModule = require(&#x22;my-module&#x22;);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## API

### &#x60;template(code, [opts])&#x60;

#### code

Type: &#x60;string&#x60;

#### options

&#x60;babel-template&#x60; accepts all of the options from [babylon], and specifies
some defaults of its own:

* &#x60;allowReturnOutsideFunction&#x60; is set to &#x60;true&#x60; by default.
* &#x60;allowSuperOutsideMethod&#x60; is set to &#x60;true&#x60; by default.

##### preserveComments

Type: &#x60;boolean&#x60;
Default: &#x60;false&#x60;

Set this to &#x60;true&#x60; to preserve any comments from the &#x60;code&#x60; parameter.

#### Return value

&#x60;babel-template&#x60; returns a &#x60;function&#x60; which is invoked with an optional object
of replacements. See the usage section for an example.

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">babel-traverse</a></h4><pre class="hidden"># babel-traverse

&#x3E; babel-traverse maintains the overall tree state, and is responsible for replacing, removing, and adding nodes.

## Install

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;sh
$ npm install --save babel-traverse
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## Usage

We can use it alongside Babylon to traverse and update nodes:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import * as babylon from &#x22;babylon&#x22;;
import traverse from &#x22;babel-traverse&#x22;;

const code = &#x60;function square(n) {
  return n * n;
}&#x60;;

const ast = babylon.parse(code);

traverse(ast, {
  enter(path) {
    if (path.isIdentifier({ name: &#x22;n&#x22; })) {
      path.node.name = &#x22;x&#x22;;
    }
  }
});

&#x3E; BigNum in pure javascript

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js)

## Install
&#x60;npm install --save bn.js&#x60;

## Usage

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const BN = require(&#x27;bn.js&#x27;);

var a = new BN(&#x27;dead&#x27;, 16);
var b = new BN(&#x27;101010&#x27;, 2);

var res = a.add(b);
console.log(res.toString(10));  // 57047
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

**Note**: decimals are not supported in this library.

## Notation

### Prefixes

There are several prefixes to instructions that affect the way the work. Here
is the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:

* &#x60;i&#x60; - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on
  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs
* &#x60;u&#x60; - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or
  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations
  like &#x60;mod()&#x60;. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be
  added to the result to make it positive

### Postfixes

The only available postfix at the moment is:

* &#x60;n&#x60; - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript
  Number. Decimals are not supported.

### Examples

* &#x60;a.iadd(b)&#x60; - perform addition on &#x60;a&#x60; and &#x60;b&#x60;, storing the result in &#x60;a&#x60;
* &#x60;a.umod(b)&#x60; - reduce &#x60;a&#x60; modulo &#x60;b&#x60;, returning positive value
* &#x60;a.iushln(13)&#x60; - shift bits of &#x60;a&#x60; left by 13

## Instructions

Prefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. &#x60;endian&#x60; - could be
either &#x60;le&#x60; (little-endian) or &#x60;be&#x60; (big-endian).

### Utilities

* &#x60;a.clone()&#x60; - clone number
* &#x60;a.toString(base, length)&#x60; - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes
* &#x60;a.toNumber()&#x60; - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)
* &#x60;a.toJSON()&#x60; - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of &#x60;toString(16)&#x60;)
* &#x60;a.toArray(endian, length)&#x60; - convert to byte &#x60;Array&#x60;, and optionally zero
  pad to length, throwing if already exceeding
* &#x60;a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)&#x60; - convert to an instance of &#x60;type&#x60;,
  which must behave like an &#x60;Array&#x60;
* &#x60;a.toBuffer(endian, length)&#x60; - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For
  compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:
  &#x60;a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)&#x60;
* &#x60;a.bitLength()&#x60; - get number of bits occupied
* &#x60;a.zeroBits()&#x60; - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits
  (example: &#x60;1010000&#x60; has 4 zero bits)
* &#x60;a.byteLength()&#x60; - return number of bytes occupied
* &#x60;a.isNeg()&#x60; - true if the number is negative

* &#x60;a.invm(b)&#x60; - inverse &#x60;a&#x60; modulo &#x60;b&#x60;

## Fast reduction

When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to
use some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm
for [Mersenne Prime][1].

### Reduction context

To enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var red = BN.red(num);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
where &#x60;num&#x60; is just a BN instance.

Or:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var red = BN.red(primeName);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Where &#x60;primeName&#x60; is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:

* &#x60;&#x27;k256&#x27;&#x60;
* &#x60;&#x27;p224&#x27;&#x60;
* &#x60;&#x27;p192&#x27;&#x60;
* &#x60;&#x27;p25519&#x27;&#x60;

Or:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var red = BN.mont(num);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

To reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. &#x60;.mont()&#x60; is generally faster than
&#x60;.red(num)&#x60;, but slower than &#x60;BN.red(primeName)&#x60;.

### Converting numbers

Before performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted
to it. Usually, this means that one should:

* Convert inputs to reducted ones
* Operate on them in reduction context
* Convert outputs back from the reduction context

Here is how one may convert numbers to &#x60;red&#x60;:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var redA = a.toRed(red);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
Where &#x60;red&#x60; is a reduction context created using instructions above

Here is how to convert them back:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var a = redA.fromRed();
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### Red instructions

Most of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their
counterparts in red context:

* &#x60;a.redAdd(b)&#x60;, &#x60;a.redIAdd(b)&#x60;
* &#x60;a.redSub(b)&#x60;, &#x60;a.redISub(b)&#x60;
* &#x60;a.redShl(num)&#x60;
* &#x60;a.redMul(b)&#x60;, &#x60;a.redIMul(b)&#x60;
* &#x60;a.redSqr()&#x60;, &#x60;a.redISqr()&#x60;
* &#x60;a.redSqrt()&#x60; - square root modulo reduction context&#x27;s prime
* &#x60;a.redInvm()&#x60; - modular inverse of the number
* &#x60;a.redNeg()&#x60;
* &#x60;a.redPow(b)&#x60; - modular exponentiation

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">boolbase</a></h4><pre class="hidden">#boolbase
This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (&#x60;trueFunc&#x60;) and one that always returns false (&#x60;falseFunc&#x60;).

###WTF?

By having only a single instance of these functions around, it&#x27;s possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [&#x60;CSSselect&#x60;](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won&#x27;t match any elements. If that&#x27;s the case, the DOM doesn&#x27;t even have to be touched.

###And why is this a separate module?

I&#x27;m trying to modularize &#x60;CSSselect&#x60; and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">boolean</a></h4><pre class="hidden">The MIT License (MIT)

Creative Commons Corporation (&#x22;Creative Commons&#x22;) is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
information available on an &#x22;as-is&#x22; basis. Creative Commons gives no
warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons
disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the
fullest extent possible.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
&#x9;wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor&#x27;s permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
     for the public:

=======================================================================

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License (&#x22;Public License&#x22;). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter&#x27;s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter&#x27;s
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.

&#x3E; A neat wrapper around node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile / FSEvents.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar)

## Why?
Node.js &#x60;fs.watch&#x60;:

* Doesn&#x27;t report filenames on MacOS.
* Doesn&#x27;t report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS.
* Often reports events twice.
* Emits most changes as &#x60;rename&#x60;.
* Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node/search?q=fs.watch&#x26;type=Issues)
* Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.

Node.js &#x60;fs.watchFile&#x60;:

* Almost as bad at event handling.
* Also does not provide any recursive watching.
* Results in high CPU utilization.

Chokidar resolves these problems.

Initially made for **[Brunch](http://brunch.io)** (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in
[gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/),
[karma](http://karma-runner.github.io),
[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2),
[browserify](http://browserify.org/),
[webpack](http://webpack.github.io/),
[BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/),
[Microsoft&#x27;s Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode),
and [many others](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/).
It has proven itself in production environments.

## How?
Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core &#x60;fs&#x60; module, but when using
&#x60;fs.watch&#x60; and &#x60;fs.watchFile&#x60; for watching, it normalizes the events it
receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.

On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin
&#x60;FSEvents&#x60; API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with
implementations like &#x60;kqueue&#x60; available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still
does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.

On other platforms, the &#x60;fs.watch&#x60;-based implementation is the default, which
avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate
watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been
specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much
more than needed.

## Getting started
Install with npm:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;sh
npm install chokidar
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Then &#x60;require&#x60; and use it in your code:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
var chokidar = require(&#x27;chokidar&#x27;);

// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles
chokidar.watch(&#x27;.&#x27;, {ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../}).on(&#x27;all&#x27;, (event, path) =&#x3E; {
  console.log(event, path);
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
// Example of a more typical implementation structure:

// Initialize watcher.
var watcher = chokidar.watch(&#x27;file, dir, glob, or array&#x27;, {
  ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,
  persistent: true
});

// Something to use when events are received.
var log = console.log.bind(console);
// Add event listeners.
watcher
  .on(&#x27;add&#x27;, path =&#x3E; log(&#x60;File ${path} has been added&#x60;))
  .on(&#x27;change&#x27;, path =&#x3E; log(&#x60;File ${path} has been changed&#x60;))
  .on(&#x27;unlink&#x27;, path =&#x3E; log(&#x60;File ${path} has been removed&#x60;));

// More possible events.
watcher
  .on(&#x27;addDir&#x27;, path =&#x3E; log(&#x60;Directory ${path} has been added&#x60;))
  .on(&#x27;unlinkDir&#x27;, path =&#x3E; log(&#x60;Directory ${path} has been removed&#x60;))
  .on(&#x27;error&#x27;, error =&#x3E; log(&#x60;Watcher error: ${error}&#x60;))
  .on(&#x27;ready&#x27;, () =&#x3E; log(&#x27;Initial scan complete. Ready for changes&#x27;))
  .on(&#x27;raw&#x27;, (event, path, details) =&#x3E; {
    log(&#x27;Raw event info:&#x27;, event, path, details);
  });

// &#x27;add&#x27;, &#x27;addDir&#x27; and &#x27;change&#x27; events also receive stat() results as second
// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats
watcher.on(&#x27;change&#x27;, (path, stats) =&#x3E; {
  if (stats) console.log(&#x60;File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}&#x60;);
});

## API

&#x60;chokidar.watch(paths, [options])&#x60;

* &#x60;paths&#x60; (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched
recursively, or glob patterns.
* &#x60;options&#x60; (object) Options object as defined below:

#### Persistence

* &#x60;persistent&#x60; (default: &#x60;true&#x60;). Indicates whether the process
should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to
&#x60;false&#x60; when using &#x60;fsevents&#x60; to watch, no more events will be emitted
after &#x60;ready&#x60;, even if the process continues to run.

#### Path filtering

* &#x60;ignored&#x60; ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)
Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is
tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it
gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second
time with two arguments (the path and the
[&#x60;fs.Stats&#x60;](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object of that path).
* &#x60;ignoreInitial&#x60; (default: &#x60;false&#x60;). If set to &#x60;false&#x60; then &#x60;add&#x60;/&#x60;addDir&#x60; events are also emitted for matching paths while
instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the &#x60;ready&#x60; event).
* &#x60;followSymlinks&#x60; (default: &#x60;true&#x60;). When &#x60;false&#x60;, only the
symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following
the link references and bubbling events through the link&#x27;s path.
* &#x60;cwd&#x60; (no default). The base directory from which watch &#x60;paths&#x60; are to be
derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.
* &#x60;disableGlobbing&#x60; (default: &#x60;false&#x60;). If set to &#x60;true&#x60; then the strings passed to &#x60;.watch()&#x60; and &#x60;.add()&#x60; are treated as
literal path names, even if they look like globs.

#### Performance

* &#x60;usePolling&#x60; (default: &#x60;false&#x60;).
Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling
leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to &#x60;false&#x60;. It is
typically necessary to **set this to &#x60;true&#x60; to successfully watch files over
a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other
non-standard situations. Setting to &#x60;true&#x60; explicitly on MacOS overrides the
&#x60;useFsEvents&#x60; default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable
to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.
* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when &#x60;usePolling: true&#x60;)
  * &#x60;interval&#x60; (default: &#x60;100&#x60;). Interval of file system polling. You may also
    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.
  * &#x60;binaryInterval&#x60; (default: &#x60;300&#x60;). Interval of file system
  polling for binary files.
  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))
* &#x60;useFsEvents&#x60; (default: &#x60;true&#x60; on MacOS). Whether to use the
&#x60;fsevents&#x60; watching interface if available. When set to &#x60;true&#x60; explicitly
and &#x60;fsevents&#x60; is available this supercedes the &#x60;usePolling&#x60; setting. When
set to &#x60;false&#x60; on MacOS, &#x60;usePolling: true&#x60; becomes the default.
* &#x60;alwaysStat&#x60; (default: &#x60;false&#x60;). If relying upon the
[&#x60;fs.Stats&#x60;](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object that may get passed with &#x60;add&#x60;, &#x60;addDir&#x60;, and &#x60;change&#x60; events, set
this to &#x60;true&#x60; to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn&#x27;t
already available from the underlying watch events.
* &#x60;depth&#x60; (default: &#x60;undefined&#x60;). If set, limits how many levels of
subdirectories will be traversed.
* &#x60;awaitWriteFinish&#x60; (default: &#x60;false&#x60;).
By default, the &#x60;add&#x60; event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before
the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some &#x60;change&#x60;
events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,
especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the
write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.
Setting &#x60;awaitWriteFinish&#x60; to &#x60;true&#x60; (or a truthy value) will poll file size,
holding its &#x60;add&#x60; and &#x60;change&#x60; events until the size does not change for a
configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily
dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should
be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.
Use with caution.
  * *&#x60;options.awaitWriteFinish&#x60; can be set to an object in order to adjust
  timing params:*
  * &#x60;awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold&#x60; (default: 2000). Amount of time in
  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.
  * &#x60;awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval&#x60; (default: 100). File size polling interval.

#### Errors
* &#x60;ignorePermissionErrors&#x60; (default: &#x60;false&#x60;). Indicates whether to watch files
that don&#x27;t have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to &#x60;EPERM&#x60;
or &#x60;EACCES&#x60; with this set to &#x60;true&#x60;, the errors will be suppressed silently.
* &#x60;atomic&#x60; (default: &#x60;true&#x60; if &#x60;useFsEvents&#x60; and &#x60;usePolling&#x60; are &#x60;false&#x60;).
Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use
&#x22;atomic writes&#x22; instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is
re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a &#x60;change&#x60; event
rather than &#x60;unlink&#x60; then &#x60;add&#x60;. If the default of 100 ms does not work well
for you, you can override it by setting &#x60;atomic&#x60; to a custom value, in
milliseconds.

### Methods &#x26; Events

&#x60;chokidar.watch()&#x60; produces an instance of &#x60;FSWatcher&#x60;. Methods of &#x60;FSWatcher&#x60;:

* &#x60;.add(path / paths)&#x60;: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* &#x60;.on(event, callback)&#x60;: Listen for an FS event.
Available events: &#x60;add&#x60;, &#x60;addDir&#x60;, &#x60;change&#x60;, &#x60;unlink&#x60;, &#x60;unlinkDir&#x60;, &#x60;ready&#x60;,
&#x60;raw&#x60;, &#x60;error&#x60;.
Additionally &#x60;all&#x60; is available which gets emitted with the underlying event
name and path for every event other than &#x60;ready&#x60;, &#x60;raw&#x60;, and &#x60;error&#x60;.
* &#x60;.unwatch(path / paths)&#x60;: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* &#x60;.close()&#x60;: Removes all listeners from watched files.
* &#x60;.getWatched()&#x60;: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file
system being watched by this &#x60;FSWatcher&#x60; instance. The object&#x27;s keys are all the
directories (using absolute paths unless the &#x60;cwd&#x60; option was used), and the
values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.

## CLI

If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out
[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to
execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.

## Install Troubleshooting

* &#x60;npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n&#x60;
  * This message is normal part of how &#x60;npm&#x60; handles optional dependencies and is
    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,
    Chokidar should function properly.

* &#x60;ERR! stack Error: Python executable &#x22;python&#x22; is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.&#x60;
  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:
    &#x60;npm config set python python2.7&#x60;

* &#x60;gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make&#x60;
  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">chromium-pickle-js</a></h4><pre class="hidden"># chromium-pickle-js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/electron/node-chromium-pickle-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/electron/node-chromium-pickle-js)

This module ports Chromium&#x27;s &#x60;Pickle&#x60; class to Node, see &#x60;Pickle&#x60;&#x27;s header for
introduction:

&#x3E; This class provides facilities for basic binary value packing and unpacking.
&#x3E;
&#x3E; The Pickle class supports appending primitive values (ints, strings, etc.)
&#x3E; to a pickle instance.  The Pickle instance grows its internal memory buffer
&#x3E; dynamically to hold the sequence of primitive values.   The internal memory
&#x3E; buffer is exposed as the &#x22;data&#x22; of the Pickle.  This &#x22;data&#x22; can be passed
&#x3E; to a Pickle object to initialize it for reading.
&#x3E;
&#x3E; When reading from a Pickle object, it is important for the consumer to know
&#x3E; what value types to read and in what order to read them as the Pickle does
&#x3E; not keep track of the type of data written to it.
&#x3E;
&#x3E; The Pickle&#x27;s data has a header which contains the size of the Pickle&#x27;s
&#x3E; payload.  It can optionally support additional space in the header.  That
&#x3E; space is controlled by the header_size parameter passed to the Pickle
&#x3E; constructor.

## Install

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;bash
$ npm install chromium-pickle-js

## Usage

By popular demand, &#x60;colors&#x60; now ships with two types of usages!

The super nifty way

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var colors = require(&#x27;colors&#x27;);

console.log(&#x27;hello&#x27;.green); // outputs green text
console.log(&#x27;i like cake and pies&#x27;.underline.red) // outputs red underlined text
console.log(&#x27;inverse the color&#x27;.inverse); // inverses the color
console.log(&#x27;OMG Rainbows!&#x27;.rainbow); // rainbow
console.log(&#x27;Run the trap&#x27;.trap); // Drops the bass

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

or a slightly less nifty way which doesn&#x27;t extend &#x60;String.prototype&#x60;

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var colors = require(&#x27;colors/safe&#x27;);

console.log(colors.green(&#x27;hello&#x27;)); // outputs green text
console.log(colors.red.underline(&#x27;i like cake and pies&#x27;)) // outputs red underlined text
console.log(colors.inverse(&#x27;inverse the color&#x27;)); // inverses the color
console.log(colors.rainbow(&#x27;OMG Rainbows!&#x27;)); // rainbow
console.log(colors.trap(&#x27;Run the trap&#x27;)); // Drops the bass

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

I prefer the first way. Some people seem to be afraid of extending &#x60;String.prototype&#x60; and prefer the second way. 

If you are writing good code you will never have an issue with the first approach. If you really don&#x27;t want to touch &#x60;String.prototype&#x60;, the second usage will not touch &#x60;String&#x60; native object.

## Disabling Colors

To disable colors you can pass the following arguments in the command line to your application:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;bash
node myapp.js --no-color
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## Console.log [string substitution](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/console.html#console_console_log_data)

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var name = &#x27;Marak&#x27;;
console.log(colors.green(&#x27;Hello %s&#x27;), name);
// outputs -&#x3E; &#x27;Hello Marak&#x27;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## Custom themes

### Using standard API

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js

var colors = require(&#x27;colors&#x27;);

colors.setTheme({
  silly: &#x27;rainbow&#x27;,
  input: &#x27;grey&#x27;,
  verbose: &#x27;cyan&#x27;,
  prompt: &#x27;grey&#x27;,
  info: &#x27;green&#x27;,
  data: &#x27;grey&#x27;,
  help: &#x27;cyan&#x27;,
  warn: &#x27;yellow&#x27;,
  debug: &#x27;blue&#x27;,
  error: &#x27;red&#x27;
});

// outputs red text
console.log(&#x22;this is an error&#x22;.error);

// outputs yellow text
console.log(&#x22;this is a warning&#x22;.warn);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### Using string safe API

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var colors = require(&#x27;colors/safe&#x27;);

// set single property
var error = colors.red;
error(&#x27;this is red&#x27;);

// set theme
colors.setTheme({
  silly: &#x27;rainbow&#x27;,
  input: &#x27;grey&#x27;,
  verbose: &#x27;cyan&#x27;,
  prompt: &#x27;grey&#x27;,
  info: &#x27;green&#x27;,
  data: &#x27;grey&#x27;,
  help: &#x27;cyan&#x27;,
  warn: &#x27;yellow&#x27;,
  debug: &#x27;blue&#x27;,
  error: &#x27;red&#x27;
});

// outputs red text
console.log(colors.error(&#x22;this is an error&#x22;));

// outputs yellow text
console.log(colors.warn(&#x22;this is a warning&#x22;));
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

*Protip: There is a secret undocumented style in &#x60;colors&#x60;. If you find the style you can summon him.*</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">combined-stream</a></h4><pre class="hidden">Copyright (c) 2011 Debuggable Limited &#x3C;felix@debuggable.com&#x3E;

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">corejs-upgrade-webpack-plugin</a></h4><pre class="hidden"># CoreJS Upgrade Webpack Plugin

I wrote this to ensure the latest version of core-js is used everywhere in an application.

Sometimes you&#x27;re depending on components or libraries that haven&#x27;t updated yet, and this can increase bundle-size, or even break your app if these dependencies didn&#x27;t have core-js as a dependency themselves.

This Webpack Plugin will essentially do a search and replace on all requires and if the require path matches &#x60;/core-js/&#x60; it will try and resolve the require.
If it can, nothing happens. If the resolve fails (this would normally break your app) this plugin tries to map the old core-js path to the new path structure, and resolve that instead.

This plugin will allow you to specify a &#x60;resolveFrom&#x60; option, so you can resolve core-js from any path you&#x27;d like.
This is useful if you know there are going to be multiple core-js version installed, and you want to pick a specific one installed somewhere.

## Install

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;sh
yarn add corejs-upgrade-webpack-plugin
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## Usage

simple example:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import CoreJSUpgradeWebpackPlugin from &#x27;corejs-upgrade-webpack-plugin&#x27;;

// add this to your webpack.plugins config
new CoreJSUpgradeWebpackPlugin();
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

example with options:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import CoreJSUpgradeWebpackPlugin from &#x27;corejs-upgrade-webpack-plugin&#x27;;

// add this to your webpack.plugins config
new CoreJSUpgradeWebpackPlugin({
  resolveFrom: process.cwd(),
});

## Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &#x201C;owner&#x201D;) of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a &#x201C;Work&#x201D;).

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
(&#x201C;Commons&#x201D;) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the &#x201C;Affirmer&#x201D;), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (&#x201C;Copyright and
   Related Rights&#x201D;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:
   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
      and translate a Work;
   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person&#x2019;s image or likeness
      depicted in a Work;
   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
      a Work;
   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
      thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer&#x2019;s Copyright
   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#x201C;Waiver&#x201D;). Affirmer
   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
   to the detriment of Affirmer&#x2019;s heirs and successors, fully intending that
   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer&#x2019;s express
   Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
   Affirmer&#x2019;s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer&#x2019;s Copyright and
   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#x201C;License&#x201D;). The License
   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
   in either case contrary to Affirmer&#x2019;s express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
      extent permissible under applicable law.
   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
      limitation any person&#x2019;s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
      CC0 or use of the Work.

## Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &#x201C;owner&#x201D;) of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a &#x201C;Work&#x201D;).

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
(&#x201C;Commons&#x201D;) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the &#x201C;Affirmer&#x201D;), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (&#x201C;Copyright and
   Related Rights&#x201D;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:
   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
      communicate, and translate a Work;
   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person&#x2019;s image or likeness
      depicted in a Work;
   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
      in a Work;
   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
      thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer&#x2019;s Copyright
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#x201C;Waiver&#x201D;). Affirmer makes
the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
detriment of Affirmer&#x2019;s heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
by the public as contemplated by Affirmer&#x2019;s express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer&#x2019;s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non
transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
license to exercise Affirmer&#x2019;s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in
all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable
law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the &#x201C;License&#x201D;). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date
CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the
License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work
or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer&#x2019;s express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
      warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory
      or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
      extent permissible under applicable law.
   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
      limitation any person&#x2019;s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
      this CC0 or use of the Work.

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">delegate</a></h4><pre class="hidden"># delegate

Lightweight event delegation.

## Install

You can get it on npm.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
npm install delegate --save
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

If you&#x27;re not into package management, just [download a ZIP](https://github.com/zenorocha/delegate/archive/master.zip) file.

## Setup

###### Node (Browserify)

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var delegate = require(&#x27;delegate&#x27;);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

###### Browser (Standalone)

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html
&#x3C;script src=&#x22;dist/delegate.js&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;/script&#x3E;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## Usage

### Add event delegation

#### With the default base (&#x60;document&#x60;)

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
delegate(&#x27;.btn&#x27;, &#x27;click&#x27;, function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

#### With an element as base

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
delegate(document.body, &#x27;.btn&#x27;, &#x27;click&#x27;, function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

#### With a selector (of existing elements) as base

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
delegate(&#x27;.container&#x27;, &#x27;.btn&#x27;, &#x27;click&#x27;, function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

#### With an array/array-like of elements as base

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
delegate(document.querySelectorAll(&#x27;.container&#x27;), &#x27;.btn&#x27;, &#x27;click&#x27;, function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### Remove event delegation

#### With a single base element (default or specified)

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var delegation = delegate(document.body, &#x27;.btn&#x27;, &#x27;click&#x27;, function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);

delegation.destroy();
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

#### With multiple elements (via selector or array)

Note: selectors are always treated as multiple elements, even if one or none are matched. &#x60;delegate()&#x60; will return an array.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var delegations = delegate(&#x27;.container&#x27;, &#x27;.btn&#x27;, &#x27;click&#x27;, function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);

delegations.forEach(function (delegation) {
    delegation.destroy();
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &#x22;Not a Contribution.&#x22;

      &#x22;Contributor&#x22; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &#x22;NOTICE&#x22; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#x22;AS IS&#x22; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

A complete solution to package and build a ready for distribution [Electron](https://electronjs.org), [Proton Native](https://proton-native.js.org/) app for macOS, Windows and Linux with &#x201C;auto update&#x201D; support out of the box.

See documentation on [electron.build](https://www.electron.build).

* NPM packages management:
    * [Native application dependencies](https://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules/) compilation (including [Yarn](http://yarnpkg.com/) support).
    * Development dependencies are never included. You don&#x27;t need to ignore them explicitly.
    * [Two package.json structure](https://www.electron.build/tutorials/two-package-structure) is supported, but you are not forced to use it even if you have native production dependencies.
* [Code Signing](https://www.electron.build/code-signing) on a CI server or development machine.
* [Auto Update](https://www.electron.build/auto-update) ready application packaging.
* Numerous target formats:
    * All platforms: &#x60;7z&#x60;, &#x60;zip&#x60;, &#x60;tar.xz&#x60;, &#x60;tar.7z&#x60;, &#x60;tar.lz&#x60;, &#x60;tar.gz&#x60;, &#x60;tar.bz2&#x60;, &#x60;dir&#x60; (unpacked directory).
    * [macOS](https://www.electron.build/configuration/mac): &#x60;dmg&#x60;, &#x60;pkg&#x60;, &#x60;mas&#x60;.
    * [Linux](https://www.electron.build/configuration/linux): [AppImage](http://appimage.org), [snap](http://snapcraft.io), debian package (&#x60;deb&#x60;), &#x60;rpm&#x60;, &#x60;freebsd&#x60;, &#x60;pacman&#x60;, &#x60;p5p&#x60;, &#x60;apk&#x60;.
    * [Windows](https://www.electron.build/configuration/win): &#x60;nsis&#x60; (Installer), &#x60;nsis-web&#x60; (Web installer), &#x60;portable&#x60; (portable app without installation), AppX (Windows Store), MSI, Squirrel.Windows.
* [Publishing artifacts](https://www.electron.build/configuration/publish) to GitHub Releases, Amazon S3, DigitalOcean Spaces and Bintray.
* Advanced building:
    * Pack in a distributable format [already packaged app](https://www.electron.build/#pack-only-in-a-distributable-format).
    * Separate [build steps](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/1102#issuecomment-271845854).
    * Build and publish in parallel, using hard links on CI server to reduce IO and disk space usage.
    * [electron-compile](https://github.com/electron/electron-compile) support (compile for release-time on the fly on build).
* [Docker](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build#docker) images to build Electron app for Linux or Windows on any platform.
* [Proton Native](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration/#proton-native) support.
* Downloads all required tools files on demand automatically (e.g. to code sign windows application, to make AppX), no need to setup.

## Installation
[Yarn](http://yarnpkg.com/) is [strongly](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/1147#issuecomment-276284477) recommended instead of npm.

&#x60;yarn add electron-builder --dev&#x60;

## Quick Setup Guide

[electron-webpack-quick-start](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack-quick-start) is a recommended way to create a new Electron application. See [Boilerplates](https://www.electron.build/#boilerplates).

1. Specify the standard fields in the application &#x60;package.json&#x60; &#x2014; [name](https://electron.build/configuration/configuration#Metadata-name), &#x60;description&#x60;, &#x60;version&#x60; and [author](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#people-fields-author-contributors).

2. Specify the [build](https://electron.build/configuration/configuration#build) configuration in the &#x60;package.json&#x60; as follows:
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;json
    &#x22;build&#x22;: {
      &#x22;appId&#x22;: &#x22;your.id&#x22;,
      &#x22;mac&#x22;: {
        &#x22;category&#x22;: &#x22;your.app.category.type&#x22;
      }
    }
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
   See [all options](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration). Option [files](https://www.electron.build/configuration/contents#files) to indicate which files should be packed in the final application, including the entry file, maybe required.

3. Add [icons](https://www.electron.build/icons).

4. Add the [scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) key to the development &#x60;package.json&#x60;:
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;json
    &#x22;scripts&#x22;: {
      &#x22;pack&#x22;: &#x22;electron-builder --dir&#x22;,
      &#x22;dist&#x22;: &#x22;electron-builder&#x22;
    }
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
    Then you can run &#x60;yarn dist&#x60; (to package in a distributable format (e.g. dmg, windows installer, deb package)) or &#x60;yarn pack&#x60; (only generates the package directory without really packaging it. This is useful for testing purposes).

    To ensure your native dependencies are always matched electron version, simply add script &#x60;&#x22;postinstall&#x22;: &#x22;electron-builder install-app-deps&#x22;&#x60; to your &#x60;package.json&#x60;.

5. If you have native addons of your own that are part of the application (not as a dependency), set [nodeGypRebuild](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration#Configuration-nodeGypRebuild) to &#x60;true&#x60;.

Please note that everything is packaged into an asar archive [by default](https://electron.build/configuration/configuration#Configuration-asar).

For an app that will be shipped to production, you should sign your application. See [Where to buy code signing certificates](https://www.electron.build/code-signing#where-to-buy-code-signing-certificate).

Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a plain javascript implementation.

NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve
for your cryptography operations.

## Incentive

ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are
even more slower.

## API

### ECDSA

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
var EC = require(&#x27;elliptic&#x27;).ec;

// Create and initialize EC context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EC(&#x27;secp256k1&#x27;);

// Generate keys
var key = ec.genKeyPair();

// Sign the message&#x27;s hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash);

// Export DER encoded signature in Array
var derSign = signature.toDER();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, derSign));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

var pubPoint = key.getPublic();
var x = pubPoint.getX();
var y = pubPoint.getY();

// Public Key MUST be either:
// 1) &#x27;04&#x27; + hex string of x + hex string of y; or
// 2) object with two hex string properties (x and y); or
// 3) object with two buffer properties (x and y)
var pub = pubPoint.encode(&#x27;hex&#x27;);                                 // case 1
var pub = { x: x.toString(&#x27;hex&#x27;), y: y.toString(&#x27;hex&#x27;) };         // case 2
var pub = { x: x.toBuffer(), y: y.toBuffer() };                   // case 3
var pub = { x: x.toArrayLike(Buffer), y: y.toArrayLike(Buffer) }; // case 3

// Import public key
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, &#x27;hex&#x27;);

// Signature MUST be either:
// 1) DER-encoded signature as hex-string; or
// 2) DER-encoded signature as buffer; or
// 3) object with two hex-string properties (r and s); or
// 4) object with two buffer properties (r and s)

var signature = &#x27;3046022100...&#x27;; // case 1
var signature = new Buffer(&#x27;...&#x27;); // case 2
var signature = { r: &#x27;b1fc...&#x27;, s: &#x27;9c42...&#x27; }; // case 3

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### EdDSA

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
var EdDSA = require(&#x27;elliptic&#x27;).eddsa;

// Create and initialize EdDSA context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EdDSA(&#x27;ed25519&#x27;);

// Create key pair from secret
var key = ec.keyFromSecret(&#x27;693e3c...&#x27;); // hex string, array or Buffer

// Sign the message&#x27;s hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash).toHex();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

// Import public key
var pub = &#x27;0a1af638...&#x27;;
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, &#x27;hex&#x27;);

// Verify signature
var signature = &#x27;70bed1...&#x27;;
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### ECDH

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
var EC = require(&#x27;elliptic&#x27;).ec;
var ec = new EC(&#x27;curve25519&#x27;);

// Generate keys
var key1 = ec.genKeyPair();
var key2 = ec.genKeyPair();

var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic());
var shared2 = key2.derive(key1.getPublic());

console.log(&#x27;Both shared secrets are BN instances&#x27;);
console.log(shared1.toString(16));
console.log(shared2.toString(16));
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

three and more members:
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
var EC = require(&#x27;elliptic&#x27;).ec;
var ec = new EC(&#x27;curve25519&#x27;);

var A = ec.genKeyPair();
var B = ec.genKeyPair();
var C = ec.genKeyPair();

var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate())
var BC = B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate())
var CA = C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())

var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate())
var BCA = BC.mul(A.getPrivate())
var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate())

console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16))
console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16))
console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16))
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

NOTE: &#x60;.derive()&#x60; returns a [BN][1] instance.

## Supported curves

Elliptic.js support following curve types:

* Short Weierstrass
* Montgomery
* Edwards
* Twisted Edwards

Following curve &#x27;presets&#x27; are embedded into the library:

* &#x60;secp256k1&#x60;
* &#x60;p192&#x60;
* &#x60;p224&#x60;
* &#x60;p256&#x60;
* &#x60;p384&#x60;
* &#x60;p521&#x60;
* &#x60;curve25519&#x60;
* &#x60;ed25519&#x60;

NOTE: That &#x60;curve25519&#x60; could not be used for ECDSA, use &#x60;ed25519&#x60; instead.

### Implementation details

ECDSA is using deterministic &#x60;k&#x60; value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of
the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective
or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.

All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is
provided by [hash.js][2]

### Related projects

* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both
  browserify and node (uses &#x60;elliptic&#x60; for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for
  node)

## errno exposed

Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.

**By errno:**

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
require(&#x27;errno&#x27;).errno[3]
// &#x2192; {
//     &#x22;errno&#x22;: 3,
//     &#x22;code&#x22;: &#x22;EACCES&#x22;,
//     &#x22;description&#x22;: &#x22;permission denied&#x22;
//   }
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

**By code:**

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
require(&#x27;errno&#x27;).code.ENOTEMPTY
// &#x2192; {
//     &#x22;errno&#x22;: 53,
//     &#x22;code&#x22;: &#x22;ENOTEMPTY&#x22;,
//     &#x22;description&#x22;: &#x22;directory not empty&#x22;
//   }
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

**Make your errors more descriptive:**

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var errno = require(&#x27;errno&#x27;)

function errmsg(err) {
  var str = &#x27;Error: &#x27;
  // if it&#x27;s a libuv error then get the description from errno
  if (errno.errno[err.errno])
    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description
  else
    str += err.message

  // if it&#x27;s a &#x60;fs&#x60; error then it&#x27;ll have a &#x27;path&#x27; property
  if (err.path)
    str += &#x27; [&#x27; + err.path + &#x27;]&#x27;

  return str
}

var fs = require(&#x27;fs&#x27;)

fs.readFile(&#x27;thisisnotarealfile.txt&#x27;, function (err, data) {
  if (err)
    console.log(errmsg(err))
})
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

**Use as a command line tool:**

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
~ $ errno 53
{
  &#x22;errno&#x22;: 53,
  &#x22;code&#x22;: &#x22;ENOTEMPTY&#x22;,
  &#x22;description&#x22;: &#x22;directory not empty&#x22;
}
~ $ errno EROFS
{
  &#x22;errno&#x22;: 56,
  &#x22;code&#x22;: &#x22;EROFS&#x22;,
  &#x22;description&#x22;: &#x22;read-only file system&#x22;
}
~ $ errno foo
No such errno/code: &#x22;foo&#x22;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.

You will need to install with &#x60;npm install errno -g&#x60; if you want the &#x60;errno&#x60; command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.

&#x3C;a name=&#x22;customerrors&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;/a&#x3E;
## Custom errors

Use &#x60;errno.custom.createError()&#x60; to create custom &#x60;Error&#x60; objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so &#x60;instanceof&#x60; becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a &#x60;cause&#x60; property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var create = require(&#x27;errno&#x27;).custom.createError
var MyError = create(&#x27;MyError&#x27;) // inherits from Error
var SpecificError = create(&#x27;SpecificError&#x27;, MyError) // inherits from MyError
var OtherError = create(&#x27;OtherError&#x27;, MyError)

// use them!
if (condition) throw new SpecificError(&#x27;Eeek! Something bad happened&#x27;)

if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Also available is a &#x60;errno.custom.FilesystemError&#x60; with in-built access to errno properties:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
fs.readFile(&#x27;foo&#x27;, function (err, data) {
  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))
  // do something else
})
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: &#x60;code&#x60;, &#x60;errno&#x60;, &#x60;path&#x60; and &#x60;message&#x60; will contain a descriptive human-readable message.

This is a simple Node.js module import resolution plugin for [&#x60;eslint-plugin-import&#x60;](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import), which supports native Node.js module resolution, module alias/mapping and custom file extensions.


## Installation

Prerequisites: Node.js &#x3E;=4.x and corresponding version of npm.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;shell
npm install eslint-plugin-import eslint-import-resolver-alias --save-dev
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;


## Usage

Pass this resolver and its parameters to &#x60;eslint-plugin-import&#x60; using your &#x60;eslint&#x60; config file, &#x60;.eslintrc&#x60; or &#x60;.eslintrc.js&#x60;.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  settings: {
    &#x27;import/resolver&#x27;: {
      alias: {
        map: [
          [&#x27;babel-polyfill&#x27;, &#x27;babel-polyfill/dist/polyfill.min.js&#x27;],
          [&#x27;helper&#x27;, &#x27;./utils/helper&#x27;],
          [&#x27;material-ui/DatePicker&#x27;, &#x27;../custom/DatePicker&#x27;],
          [&#x27;material-ui&#x27;, &#x27;material-ui-ie10&#x27;]
        ],
        extensions: [&#x27;.ts&#x27;, &#x27;.js&#x27;, &#x27;.jsx&#x27;, &#x27;.json&#x27;]
      }
    }
  }
};
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Note:

- The alias config object contains two properties, &#x60;map&#x60; and &#x60;extensions&#x60;, both of which are array types
- The item of &#x60;map&#x60; array is also array type which contains 2 string
    + The first string represents the alias of module name or path
    + The second string represents the actual module name or path
- The &#x60;map&#x60; item &#x60;[&#x27;helper&#x27;, &#x27;./utils/helper&#x27;]&#x60; means that the modules which match &#x60;helper&#x60; or &#x60;helper/*&#x60; will be resolved to &#x60;./utils/helper&#x60; or &#x60;./utils/helper/*&#x60; which are located relative to the &#x60;process current working directory&#x60; (almost the project root directory). If you just want to resolve &#x60;helper&#x60; to &#x60;./utils/helper&#x60;, use &#x60;[&#x27;^helper$&#x27;, &#x27;./utils/helper&#x27;]&#x60; instead. See [issue #3](https://github.com/johvin/eslint-import-resolver-alias/issues/3)
- The order of &#x27;material-ui/DatePicker&#x27; and &#x27;material-ui&#x27; cannot be reversed, otherwise the alias rule &#x27;material-ui/DatePicker&#x27; does not work
- The default value of &#x60;extensions&#x60; property is &#x60;[&#x27;.js&#x27;, &#x27;.json&#x27;, &#x27;.node&#x27;]&#x60; if it is assigned to an empty array or not specified

*If the &#x60;extensions&#x60; property is not specified, the config object can be simplified to the &#x60;map&#x60; array.*

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  settings: {
    &#x27;import/resolver&#x27;: {
      alias: [
        [&#x27;babel-polyfill&#x27;, &#x27;babel-polyfill/dist/polyfill.min.js&#x27;],
        [&#x27;helper&#x27;, &#x27;./utils/helper&#x27;],
        [&#x27;material-ui/DatePicker&#x27;, &#x27;../custom/DatePicker&#x27;],
        [&#x27;material-ui&#x27;, &#x27;material-ui-ie10&#x27;]
      ]
    }
  }
};
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

When the config is not a valid object (such as &#x60;true&#x60;), the resolver falls back to native Node.js module resolution.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  settings: {
    &#x27;import/resolver&#x27;: {
      alias: true
    }
  }
};
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Next, install &#x60;eslint-plugin-json&#x60;:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
$ npm install eslint-plugin-json --save-dev
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

**Note:** If you installed ESLint globally (using the &#x60;-g&#x60; flag) then you must also install &#x60;eslint-plugin-json&#x60; globally.

## Usage

Add &#x60;json&#x60; to the plugins section of your &#x60;.eslintrc&#x60; configuration file. You can omit the &#x60;eslint-plugin-&#x60; prefix:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;json
{
    &#x22;plugins&#x22;: [
        &#x22;json&#x22;
    ]
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

You can run ESLint on individual JSON files or you can use the &#x60;--ext&#x60; flag to add JSON files to the list.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
eslint . --ext .json --ext .js
eslint example.json
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## FAQs


#### How does eslint-plugin-json work?

Starting from version 1.3, this plugin relies on what [VSCode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-json-languageservice)
uses for its implementation of JSON validation. 
This plugin used to use JSHint, however due to the large size of 
this dependency, it was replaced.


#### Why doesn&#x27;t this plugin use &#x60;eslint&#x60; itself or just &#x60;JSON.parse&#x60;?

&#x60;eslint&#x60;&#x27;s parser is a JavaScript parser. JSON is a stricter subset and things
that are valid JavaScript are not valid JSON. This is why something more specific 
is more appropriate.

While &#x60;JSON.parse&#x60; seems ideal, it is not designed to continue after the first error.
So if you have a missing trailing comma in the start of the file, the rest of the file
will go unlinted. A smarter parser that can self-correct after seeing errors is needed
which the VSCode implementation provides by leveraging the
[jsonc-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonc-parser) module.


#### Will this plugin provide more configuration?

Now that we have moved to a different implementation for our validation, a lot
more things are possible. Optional support for JSON comments, trailing commas
and schemas are possible.

Additionally, support for autofixing common errors is also possible.


#### Is &#x60;eslint&#x60; really the best tool to lint my JSON?

Not really. &#x60;eslint&#x60; plugin interface wasn&#x27;t designed to lint a completely different language but
its interface is flexible enough to allow it. So this plugin is certainly unusual.

Ideally, your editor would natively supports linting JSON. If it doesn&#x27;t though, then might as well
use this plugin. Hacky linting is better than no linting :)</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y</a></h4><pre class="hidden">The MIT License (MIT)

      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

Esrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is
[ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
recursive traversing functionality.

### Example Usage

The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
esrecurse.visit(ast, {
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

We can use &#x60;Visitor&#x60; instance.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});

visitor.visit(ast);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

We can inherit &#x60;Visitor&#x60; instance easily.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
class Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {
    constructor()
    {
        super(null);
    }

    XXXStatement(node) {
    }
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    this.visit(node.left);
    // do something...
    this.visit(node.right);
};
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    // do something...
    this.visitChildren(node);
};
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

The &#x60;childVisitorKeys&#x60; option does customize the behaviour of &#x60;this.visitChildren(node)&#x60;.
We can use user-defined node types.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
// This tree contains a user-defined &#x60;TestExpression&#x60; node.
var tree = {
    type: &#x27;TestExpression&#x27;,

    // This &#x27;argument&#x27; is the property containing the other **node**.
    argument: {
        type: &#x27;Literal&#x27;,
        value: 20
    },

    // This &#x27;extended&#x27; is the property not containing the other **node**.
    extended: true
};
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        // Extending the existing traversing rules.
        childVisitorKeys: {
            // TargetNodeName: [ &#x27;keys&#x27;, &#x27;containing&#x27;, &#x27;the&#x27;, &#x27;other&#x27;, &#x27;**node**&#x27; ]
            TestExpression: [&#x27;argument&#x27;]
        }
    }
);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

We can use the &#x60;fallback&#x60; option as well.
If the &#x60;fallback&#x60; option is &#x60;&#x22;iteration&#x22;&#x60;, &#x60;esrecurse&#x60; would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. &#x60;node.parent&#x60;).

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: &#x27;iteration&#x27;
    }
);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

If the &#x60;fallback&#x60; option is a function, &#x60;esrecurse&#x60; calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. &#x60;node.parent&#x60;).

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: function (node) {
            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {
                return key !== &#x27;argument&#x27;
            });
        }
    }
);

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">filelist</a></h4><pre class="hidden">## FileList

A FileList is a lazy-evaluated list of files. When given a list
of glob patterns for possible files to be included in the file
list, instead of searching the file structures to find the files,
a FileList holds the pattern for latter use.

This allows you to define a FileList to match any number of
files, but only search out the actual files when then FileList
itself is actually used. The key is that the first time an
element of the FileList/Array is requested, the pending patterns
are resolved into a real list of file names.

### Usage

Add files to the list with the &#x60;include&#x60; method. You can add glob
patterns, individual files, or RegExp objects. When the Array
methods are invoked on the FileList, these items are resolved to
an actual list of files.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
var fl = new FileList();
fl.include(&#x27;test/*.js&#x27;);
fl.exclude(&#x27;test/helpers.js&#x27;);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Use the &#x60;exclude&#x60; method to override inclusions. You can use this
when your inclusions are too broad.

### Array methods

FileList has lazy-evaluated versions of most of the array
methods, including the following:

* join
* pop
* push
* concat
* reverse
* shift
* unshift
* slice
* splice
* sort
* filter
* forEach
* some
* every
* map
* indexOf
* lastIndexOf
* reduce
* reduceRight

When you call one of these methods, the items in the FileList
will be resolved to the full list of files, and the method will
be invoked on that result.

### Special &#x60;length&#x60; method

&#x60;length&#x60;: FileList includes a length *method* (instead of a
property) which returns the number of actual files in the list
once it&#x27;s been resolved.

### FileList-specific methods

&#x60;include&#x60;: Add a filename/glob/regex to the list

&#x60;exclude&#x60;: Override inclusions by excluding a filename/glob/regex

&#x60;resolve&#x60;: Resolve the items in the FileList to the full list of
files. This method is invoked automatically when one of the array
methods is called.

&#x60;toArray&#x60;: Immediately resolves the list of items, and returns an
actual array of filepaths.

&#x60;clearInclusions&#x60;: Clears any pending items -- must be used
before resolving the list.

&#x60;clearExclusions&#x60;: Clears the list of exclusions rules.

&#x22;Contribution&#x22; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#x22;AS IS&#x22; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      &#x22;Source&#x22; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

      source, and configuration files.

      &#x22;Object&#x22; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &#x22;Work&#x22; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &#x22;Derivative Works&#x22; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &#x22;Contribution&#x22; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &#x22;submitted&#x22;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &#x22;Not a Contribution.&#x22;

      &#x22;Contributor&#x22; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &#x22;NOTICE&#x22; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#x22;AS IS&#x22; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">glob-to-regexp</a></h4><pre class="hidden"># Glob To Regular Expression

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fitzgen/glob-to-regexp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fitzgen/glob-to-regexp)

Turn a \*-wildcard style glob (&#x60;&#x22;*.min.js&#x22;&#x60;) into a regular expression
(&#x60;/^.*\.min\.js$/&#x60;)!

To match bash-like globs, eg. &#x60;?&#x60; for any single-character match, &#x60;[a-z]&#x60; for
character ranges, and &#x60;{*.html, *.js}&#x60; for multiple alternatives, call with
&#x60;{ extended: true }&#x60;.

To obey [globstars &#x60;**&#x60;](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) rules set option &#x60;{globstar: true}&#x60;.
NOTE: This changes the behavior of &#x60;*&#x60; when &#x60;globstar&#x60; is &#x60;true&#x60; as shown below:
When &#x60;{globstar: true}&#x60;: &#x60;/foo/**&#x60; will match any string that starts with &#x60;/foo/&#x60;
like &#x60;/foo/index.htm&#x60;, &#x60;/foo/bar/baz.txt&#x60;, etc.  Also, &#x60;/foo/**/*.txt&#x60; will match
any string that starts with &#x60;/foo/&#x60; and ends with &#x60;.txt&#x60; like &#x60;/foo/bar.txt&#x60;,
&#x60;/foo/bar/baz.txt&#x60;, etc.
Whereas &#x60;/foo/*&#x60; (single &#x60;*&#x60;, not a globstar) will match strings that start with
&#x60;/foo/&#x60; like &#x60;/foo/index.htm&#x60;, &#x60;/foo/baz.txt&#x60; but will not match strings that
contain a &#x60;/&#x60; to the right like &#x60;/foo/bar/baz.txt&#x60;, &#x60;/foo/bar/baz/qux.dat&#x60;, etc.

Set flags on the resulting &#x60;RegExp&#x60; object by adding the &#x60;flags&#x60; property to the option object, eg &#x60;{ flags: &#x22;i&#x22; }&#x60; for ignoring case.

## Install

    npm install glob-to-regexp

## Usage
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var globToRegExp = require(&#x27;glob-to-regexp&#x27;);
var re = globToRegExp(&#x22;p*uck&#x22;);
re.test(&#x22;pot luck&#x22;); // true
re.test(&#x22;pluck&#x22;); // true
re.test(&#x22;puck&#x22;); // true

re = globToRegExp(&#x22;*.min.js&#x22;);
re.test(&#x22;http://example.com/jquery.min.js&#x22;); // true
re.test(&#x22;http://example.com/jquery.min.js.map&#x22;); // false

re = globToRegExp(&#x22;*/www/*.js&#x22;);
re.test(&#x22;http://example.com/www/app.js&#x22;); // true
re.test(&#x22;http://example.com/www/lib/factory-proxy-model-observer.js&#x22;); // true

// Extended globs
re = globToRegExp(&#x22;*/www/{*.js,*.html}&#x22;, { extended: true });
re.test(&#x22;http://example.com/www/app.js&#x22;); // true
re.test(&#x22;http://example.com/www/index.html&#x22;); // true

Gonzales PE is a CSS parser which plays nicely with preprocessors.    
Currently those are supported: SCSS, Sass, LESS.    
Try out Gonzales PE online: [Gonzales PE Playground](https://tonyganch.io/gonzales-pe/).

## Install

(1) To install command-line tool globally:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;bash
npm install -g git://github.com/tonyganch/gonzales-pe.git#dev
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

(2) To install parser as a project dependency:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;bash
npm install --save git://github.com/tonyganch/gonzales-pe.git#dev
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

(3) If for some reason you want to build files yourself:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;bash
# Clone the repo.
git clone git@github.com:tonyganch/gonzales-pe.git
# Go to dev branch.
git checkout dev
# Install project dependencies.
npm install
# Install git hooks and build files.
npm run init
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## API

Basically there are a few things you can do:

1. parse css string and get a parse tree in return;
2. modify tree nodes;
3. remove tree nodes;
4. add new nodes to the tree;
5. convert modified tree back to a string.

The different type of tree nodes can be found in [docs/node-types.md](https://github.com/tonyganch/gonzales-pe/blob/dev/docs/node-types.md).

In examples below I assume that &#x60;gonzales&#x60; is a parser module and &#x60;parseTree&#x60;
is some parsed css:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
let gonzales = require(&#x27;gonzales-pe&#x27;);
let parseTree = gonzales.parse(css);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### gonzales.createNode(options)

## Test

To run tests:

    npm test

This command will build library files from sources and run tests on all files
in syntax directories.

Every test has 3 files: source stylesheet, expected parse tree and expected
string compiled back from parse tree to css.

If some tests fail, you can find information in test logs:

- &#x60;log/test.log&#x60; contains all information from stdout;
- &#x60;log/expected.txt&#x60; contains only expected text;
- &#x60;log/result.txt&#x60; contains only result text.

The last two are made for your convenience: you can use any diff app to see
the defference between them.

If you want to test one specific string or get a general idea of how Gonzales
works, you can use &#x60;test/ast.js&#x60; file.    
Simply change the first two strings (&#x60;css&#x60; and &#x60;syntax&#x60; vars) and run:

    node test/single-test.js

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Or bower, too.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
bower install good-listener --save
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

If you&#x27;re not into package management, just [download a ZIP](https://github.com/zenorocha/good-listener/archive/master.zip) file.

## Setup

###### Node (Browserify)

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var listen = require(&#x27;good-listener&#x27;);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

###### Browser (Standalone)

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html
&#x3C;script src=&#x22;dist/good-listener.js&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;/script&#x3E;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## Usage

### Add an event listener

By passing a string selector [(see full demo)](https://github.com/zenorocha/good-listener/blob/master/demo/selector.html).

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
listen(&#x27;.btn&#x27;, &#x27;click&#x27;, function(e) {
    console.log(e);
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Or by passing a HTML element [(see full demo)](https://github.com/zenorocha/good-listener/blob/master/demo/node.html).

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var logo = document.getElementById(&#x27;logo&#x27;);

listen(logo, &#x27;click&#x27;, function(e) {
    console.log(e);
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Or by passing a list of HTML elements [(see full demo)](https://github.com/zenorocha/good-listener/blob/master/demo/nodelist.html).

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var anchors = document.querySelectorAll(&#x27;a&#x27;);

listen(anchors, &#x27;click&#x27;, function(e) {
    console.log(e);
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### Remove an event listener

By calling the &#x60;destroy&#x60; function that returned from previous operation [(see full demo)](https://github.com/zenorocha/good-listener/blob/master/demo/destroy.html).

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var listener = listen(&#x27;.btn&#x27;, &#x27;click&#x27;, function(e) {
    console.log(e);
});

listener.destroy();
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">gud</a></h4><pre class="hidden"># gud

&#x3E; Create a &#x27;gud nuff&#x27; (not cryptographically secure) globally unique id

## Install

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
yarn add gud
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## Usage

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const gud = require(&#x27;gud&#x27;);

console.log(gud()); // 1
console.log(gud()); // 2
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

This is ever so slightly better than using something like &#x60;_.uniqueId&#x60; because
it will work across multiple copies of the same module.

Do not use this in place of actual UUIDs, security folks will hate me.

This will not be unique across processes/workers.

### An HTTP(s) proxy &#x60;http.Agent&#x60; implementation for HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an &#x60;http.Agent&#x60; implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in &#x60;https&#x60; module.

Specifically, this &#x60;Agent&#x60; implementation connects to an intermediary &#x22;proxy&#x22;
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the &#x22;Examples&#x22; section below for more.


Installation
------------

Install with &#x60;npm&#x60;:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; bash
$ npm install https-proxy-agent
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;


Examples
--------

#### &#x60;https&#x60; module example

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; js
var url = require(&#x27;url&#x27;);
var https = require(&#x27;https&#x27;);
var HttpsProxyAgent = require(&#x27;https-proxy-agent&#x27;);

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || &#x27;http://168.63.76.32:3128&#x27;;
console.log(&#x27;using proxy server %j&#x27;, proxy);

// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || &#x27;https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate&#x27;;
console.log(&#x27;attempting to GET %j&#x27;, endpoint);
var options = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the &#x60;HttpsProxyAgent&#x60; class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);
options.agent = agent;

https.get(options, function (res) {
  console.log(&#x27;&#x22;response&#x22; event!&#x27;, res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

#### &#x60;ws&#x60; WebSocket connection example

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; js
var url = require(&#x27;url&#x27;);
var WebSocket = require(&#x27;ws&#x27;);
var HttpsProxyAgent = require(&#x27;https-proxy-agent&#x27;);

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || &#x27;http://168.63.76.32:3128&#x27;;
console.log(&#x27;using proxy server %j&#x27;, proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || &#x27;ws://echo.websocket.org&#x27;;
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
console.log(&#x27;attempting to connect to WebSocket %j&#x27;, endpoint);

// create an instance of the &#x60;HttpsProxyAgent&#x60; class with the proxy server information
var options = url.parse(proxy);

var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);

// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on(&#x27;open&#x27;, function () {
  console.log(&#x27;&#x22;open&#x22; event!&#x27;);
  socket.send(&#x27;hello world&#x27;);
});

socket.on(&#x27;message&#x27;, function (data, flags) {
  console.log(&#x27;&#x22;message&#x22; event! %j %j&#x27;, data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

API
---

### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)

The &#x60;HttpsProxyAgent&#x60; class implements an &#x60;http.Agent&#x60; subclass that connects
to the specified &#x22;HTTP(s) proxy server&#x22; in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP &#x60;CONNECT&#x60; method][CONNECT].

The &#x60;options&#x60; argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an
&#x22;options&#x22; object with more specific properties:

  * &#x60;host&#x60; - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use &#x60;hostname&#x60; as well). Required.
  * &#x60;port&#x60; - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.
  * &#x60;protocol&#x60; - String - If &#x60;https:&#x60;, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.
  * &#x60;headers&#x60; - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.
  * Any other options given are passed to the &#x60;net.connect()&#x60;/&#x60;tls.connect()&#x60; functions.

# ignore

&#x60;ignore&#x60; is a manager, filter and parser which implemented in pure JavaScript according to the .gitignore [spec](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

Pay attention that [&#x60;minimatch&#x60;](https://www.npmjs.org/package/minimatch) does not work in the gitignore way. To filter filenames according to .gitignore file, I recommend this module.

##### Tested on

- Linux + Node: &#x60;0.8&#x60; - &#x60;7.x&#x60;
- Windows + Node: &#x60;0.10&#x60; - &#x60;7.x&#x60;, node &#x3C; &#x60;0.10&#x60; is not tested due to the lack of support of appveyor.

Actually, &#x60;ignore&#x60; does not rely on any versions of node specially.

## Table Of Main Contents

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Guide for 2.x -&#x3E; 3.x](#upgrade-2x---3x)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- Related Packages
  - [&#x60;glob-gitignore&#x60;](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob-gitignore) matches files using patterns and filters them according to gitignore rules.

## Usage

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const ignore = require(&#x27;ignore&#x27;)
const ig = ignore().add([&#x27;.abc/*&#x27;, &#x27;!.abc/d/&#x27;])
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### Filter the given paths

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const paths = [
  &#x27;.abc/a.js&#x27;,    // filtered out
  &#x27;.abc/d/e.js&#x27;   // included
]

ig.filter(paths)        // [&#x27;.abc/d/e.js&#x27;]
ig.ignores(&#x27;.abc/a.js&#x27;) // true
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### As the filter function

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
paths.filter(ig.createFilter()); // [&#x27;.abc/d/e.js&#x27;]
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### Win32 paths will be handled

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
ig.filter([&#x27;.abc\\a.js&#x27;, &#x27;.abc\\d\\e.js&#x27;])
// if the code above runs on windows, the result will be
// [&#x27;.abc\\d\\e.js&#x27;]
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## Why another ignore?

- &#x60;ignore&#x60; is a standalone module, and is much simpler so that it could easy work with other programs, unlike [isaacs](https://npmjs.org/~isaacs)&#x27;s [fstream-ignore](https://npmjs.org/package/fstream-ignore) which must work with the modules of the fstream family.

- &#x60;ignore&#x60; only contains utility methods to filter paths according to the specified ignore rules, so
  - &#x60;ignore&#x60; never try to find out ignore rules by traversing directories or fetching from git configurations.
  - &#x60;ignore&#x60; don&#x27;t cares about sub-modules of git projects.

- Exactly according to [gitignore man page](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), fixes some known matching issues of fstream-ignore, such as:
  - &#x27;&#x60;/*.js&#x60;&#x27; should only match &#x27;&#x60;a.js&#x60;&#x27;, but not &#x27;&#x60;abc/a.js&#x60;&#x27;.
  - &#x27;&#x60;**/foo&#x60;&#x27; should match &#x27;&#x60;foo&#x60;&#x27; anywhere.
  - Prevent re-including a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.
  - Handle trailing whitespaces:
    - &#x60;&#x27;a &#x27;&#x60;(one space) should not match &#x60;&#x27;a  &#x27;&#x60;(two spaces).
    - &#x60;&#x27;a \ &#x27;&#x60; matches &#x60;&#x27;a  &#x27;&#x60;
  - All test cases are verified with the result of &#x60;git check-ignore&#x60;.

## Methods

### .add(pattern)
### .add(patterns)

- **pattern** &#x60;String|Ignore&#x60; An ignore pattern string, or the &#x60;Ignore&#x60; instance
- **patterns** &#x60;Array.&#x3C;pattern&#x3E;&#x60; Array of ignore patterns.

Adds a rule or several rules to the current manager.

Returns &#x60;this&#x60;

Notice that a line starting with &#x60;&#x27;#&#x27;&#x60;(hash) is treated as a comment. Put a backslash (&#x60;&#x27;\&#x27;&#x60;) in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash, if you want to ignore a file with a hash at the beginning of the filename.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
ignore().add(&#x27;#abc&#x27;).ignores(&#x27;#abc&#x27;)    // false
ignore().add(&#x27;\#abc&#x27;).ignores(&#x27;#abc&#x27;)   // true
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

&#x60;pattern&#x60; could either be a line of ignore pattern or a string of multiple ignore patterns, which means we could just &#x60;ignore().add()&#x60; the content of a ignore file:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
ignore()
.add(fs.readFileSync(filenameOfGitignore).toString())
.filter(filenames)
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

&#x60;pattern&#x60; could also be an &#x60;ignore&#x60; instance, so that we could easily inherit the rules of another &#x60;Ignore&#x60; instance.

### &#x3C;strike&#x3E;.addIgnoreFile(path)&#x3C;/strike&#x3E;

REMOVED in &#x60;3.x&#x60; for now.

To upgrade &#x60;ignore@2.x&#x60; up to &#x60;3.x&#x60;, use

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const fs = require(&#x27;fs&#x27;)

if (fs.existsSync(filename)) {
  ignore().add(fs.readFileSync(filename).toString())
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

instead.


### .ignores(pathname)

&#x3E; new in 3.2.0

Returns &#x60;Boolean&#x60; whether &#x60;pathname&#x60; should be ignored.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
ig.ignores(&#x27;.abc/a.js&#x27;)    // true
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### .filter(paths)

Filters the given array of pathnames, and returns the filtered array.

- **paths** &#x60;Array.&#x3C;path&#x3E;&#x60; The array of &#x60;pathname&#x60;s to be filtered.

**NOTICE** that:

- &#x60;pathname&#x60; should be a string that have been &#x60;path.join()&#x60;ed, or the return value of &#x60;path.relative()&#x60; to the current directory.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
// WRONG
ig.ignores(&#x27;./abc&#x27;)

// WRONG, for it will never happen.
// If the gitignore rule locates at the root directory,
// &#x60;&#x27;/abc&#x27;&#x60; should be changed to &#x60;&#x27;abc&#x27;&#x60;.
// &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
// path.relative(&#x27;/&#x27;, &#x27;/abc&#x27;)  -&#x3E; &#x27;abc&#x27;
// &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
ig.ignores(&#x27;/abc&#x27;)

// Right
ig.ignores(&#x27;abc&#x27;)

// Right
ig.ignores(path.join(&#x27;./abc&#x27;))  // path.join(&#x27;./abc&#x27;) -&#x3E; &#x27;abc&#x27;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

- In other words, each &#x60;pathname&#x60; here should be a relative path to the directory of the git ignore rules.

Suppose the dir structure is:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
/path/to/your/repo
    |-- a
    |   |-- a.js
    |
    |-- .b
    |
    |-- .c
         |-- .DS_store
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Then the &#x60;paths&#x60; might be like this:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
[
  &#x27;a/a.js&#x27;
  &#x27;.b&#x27;,
  &#x27;.c/.DS_store&#x27;
]
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Usually, you could use [&#x60;glob&#x60;](http://npmjs.org/package/glob) with &#x60;option.mark = true&#x60; to fetch the structure of the current directory:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const glob = require(&#x27;glob&#x27;)

glob(&#x27;**&#x27;, {
  // Adds a / character to directory matches.
  mark: true
}, (err, files) =&#x3E; {
  if (err) {
    return console.error(err)
  }

  let filtered = ignore().add(patterns).filter(files)
  console.log(filtered)
})
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### .createFilter()

Creates a filter function which could filter an array of paths with &#x60;Array.prototype.filter&#x60;.

Returns &#x60;function(path)&#x60; the filter function.

****

## Upgrade 2.x -&#x3E; 3.x

- All &#x60;options&#x60; of 2.x are unnecessary and removed, so just remove them.
- &#x60;ignore()&#x60; instance is no longer an [&#x60;EventEmitter&#x60;](nodejs.org/api/events.html), and all events are unnecessary and removed.
- &#x60;.addIgnoreFile()&#x60; is removed, see the [.addIgnoreFile](#addignorefilepath) section for details.

****

## Contributing

The code of &#x60;node-ignore&#x60; is based on es6 and babel, but babel and its preset is not included in the &#x60;dependencies&#x60; field of package.json, so that the installation process of test cases will not fail in older versions of node.

So use &#x60;bash install.sh&#x60; to install dependencies and &#x60;bash test.sh&#x60; to run test cases in your local machine.

==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court&#x27;s implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura&#x27;s modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Installation
------------

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html
&#x3C;script type=&#x22;text/javascript&#x22; src=&#x22;/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;/script&#x3E;
&#x3C;script&#x3E;
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
&#x3C;/script&#x3E;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;bash
npm install imurmurhash
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Then simply include it in your scripts:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
MurmurHash3 = require(&#x27;imurmurhash&#x27;);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Quick Example
-------------

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3(&#x27;string&#x27;);

// Incrementally add text
hashState.hash(&#x27;more strings&#x27;);
hashState.hash(&#x27;even more strings&#x27;);

// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState.hash(&#x27;and&#x27;).hash(&#x27;some&#x27;).hash(&#x27;more&#x27;);

// Get a result
hashState.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Functions
---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the &#x60;new&#x60; keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use &#x60;new&#x60; to create a new state object. For example:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
...

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to &#x60;result()&#x60;. Returns &#x60;this&#x60; so calls can be chained.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via &#x60;hash&#x60;.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3(&#x27;this is a test string&#x27;).result();
// 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3(&#x27;this is a&#x27;);
m.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m.hash(&#x27; test string&#x27;).result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns &#x60;this&#x60; so calls can be chained.

ip.isV6Format(&#x27;::ffff:127.0.0.1&#x27;); // true

// operate on buffers in-place
var buf = new Buffer(128);
var offset = 64;
ip.toBuffer(&#x27;127.0.0.1&#x27;, buf, offset);  // [127, 0, 0, 1] at offset 64
ip.toString(buf, offset, 4);            // &#x27;127.0.0.1&#x27;

// subnet information
ip.subnet(&#x27;192.168.1.134&#x27;, &#x27;255.255.255.192&#x27;)
// { networkAddress: &#x27;192.168.1.128&#x27;,

//   broadcastAddress: &#x27;192.168.1.191&#x27;,
//   subnetMask: &#x27;255.255.255.192&#x27;,
//   subnetMaskLength: 26,
//   numHosts: 62,
//   length: 64,
//   contains: function(addr){...} }
ip.cidrSubnet(&#x27;192.168.1.134/26&#x27;)
// Same as previous.

// range checking
ip.cidrSubnet(&#x27;192.168.1.134/26&#x27;).contains(&#x27;192.168.1.190&#x27;) // true


// ipv4 long conversion
ip.toLong(&#x27;127.0.0.1&#x27;); // 2130706433
ip.fromLong(2130706433); // &#x27;127.0.0.1&#x27;

GPL version 3
=============

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &#x3C;http://fsf.org/&#x3E;
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers&#x27; and authors&#x27; protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&#x27; and
authors&#x27; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users&#x27; freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  &#x22;This License&#x22; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  &#x22;Copyright&#x22; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  &#x22;The Program&#x22; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as &#x22;you&#x22;.  &#x22;Licensees&#x22; and
&#x22;recipients&#x22; may be individuals or organizations.

  To &#x22;modify&#x22; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &#x22;modified version&#x22; of the
earlier work or a work &#x22;based on&#x22; the earlier work.

  A &#x22;covered work&#x22; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To &#x22;propagate&#x22; a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To &#x22;convey&#x22; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays &#x22;Appropriate Legal Notices&#x22;
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The &#x22;source code&#x22; for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  &#x22;Object code&#x22; means any non-source
form of a work.

  A &#x22;Standard Interface&#x22; means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The &#x22;System Libraries&#x22; of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
&#x22;Major Component&#x22;, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The &#x22;Corresponding Source&#x22; for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#x27;s
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users&#x27; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#x27;s
users, your or third parties&#x27; legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#x27;s source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    &#x22;keep intact all notices&#x22;.

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
&#x22;aggregate&#x22; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#x27;s users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A &#x22;User Product&#x22; is either (1) a &#x22;consumer product&#x22;, which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, &#x22;normally used&#x22; refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  &#x22;Installation Information&#x22; for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  &#x22;Additional permissions&#x22; are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &#x22;further
restrictions&#x22; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An &#x22;entity transaction&#x22; is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party&#x27;s predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A &#x22;contributor&#x22; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor&#x27;s &#x22;contributor version&#x22;.

  A contributor&#x27;s &#x22;essential patent claims&#x22; are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, &#x22;control&#x22; includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor&#x27;s essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a &#x22;patent license&#x22; is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To &#x22;grant&#x22; such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  &#x22;Knowingly relying&#x22; means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient&#x27;s use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is &#x22;discriminatory&#x22; if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others&#x27; Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License &#x22;or any later version&#x22; applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#x27;s
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &#x22;AS IS&#x22; WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### Preamble

The Open Data Commons Attribution License is a license agreement
intended to allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database
subject only to the attribution requirements set out in Section 4.

Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,
audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),
and so this license only governs the rights over the Database, and not
the contents of the Database individually. Licensors may therefore wish
to use this license together with another license for the contents.

Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be
covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,
trademark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights
over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may
have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing
activities not covered by this License.

------

The Licensor (as defined below) 

and 

You (as defined below) 

agree as follows: 

### 1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words

or the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables
a Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative
Database.  Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a
computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no
transfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.

&#x22;Contents&#x22; - The contents of this Database, which includes the
information, independent works, or other material collected into the
Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual
data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.

&#x22;Database&#x22; - A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a
systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic

of databases, as amended or succeeded.

&#x22;Database Right&#x22; - Means rights resulting from the Chapter III (&#x22;sui
generis&#x22;) rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed
by member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of
the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar
rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4. 

&#x22;Derivative Database&#x22; - Means a database based upon the Database, and
includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any
other alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the
Contents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or
Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new
Database.

&#x22;Extraction&#x22; - Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a
Substantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in
any form.

### 2.0 What this License covers

2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:

  a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;

  b. A license of the Database Right; and

  c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.

2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the
Database, including:

  a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.
  The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the
  Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents
  independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright
  law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database
  model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation
  of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table
  indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of
  Contents stored in the Database;

  b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and
  Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.
  Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the
  Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed
  from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would
  not infringe any applicable copyright; and

  c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for
  access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of
  use on this access as outlined in this License. 

2.3 Rights not covered. 

  a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making
  or operation of the Database; 

  b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the
  Database; and

  c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the
  Database. 

2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of
the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,
including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality
rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database
Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.
For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this
License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could
have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of
the rights over the images.  

### 3.0 Rights granted

3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor
grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but
only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of
any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly
include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To
the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the
future. 

The rights granted cover, for example:

  a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of
  the Contents;

  b. Creation of Derivative Databases;

  c. Creation of Collective Databases;

  d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and
  in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative
  Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and

  e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or
  performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in
  part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective
  Databases.

3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:

  a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in
  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
  compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
  the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
  of the rights granted under this License;

  b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in
  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
  compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
  exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
  the rights granted under this License; and,

  c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
  royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is
  a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
  schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
  granted under this License.

3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop
distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that
this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice
of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section
10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.

### 4.0 Conditions of Use

4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to
Your complying with the following conditions of use. These are important
conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be
in material breach of its terms.

4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You
must: 

  a. Do so only under the terms of this License;

  b. Include a copy of this License or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
  with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the
  Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; 

  c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices
  that refer to this License; and

  d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular
  file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a
  location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to
  look for it.

4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced
Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you
Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with
the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,
views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced
Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it
is available under this License.

  a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under
  Section 4.3:

        Contains information from DATABASE NAME which is made available
        under the ODC Attribution License.

DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a
hyperlink to the location of the Database. &#x22;ODC Attribution License&#x22;
should contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If
hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the
required URI&#x27;s with the above notice.

4.4 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time
You communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the
Contents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same
terms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may
enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are
solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made
by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed
under this License.

### 5.0 Moral rights

5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights
to be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment
that would otherwise prejudice the author&#x27;s honour and reputation, or
any other derogatory treatment:

  a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives
  all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest
  extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section
  10.4; 

  b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant
  jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral
  rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the
  fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under
  Section 10.4; and

  c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert
  moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their
  moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.

Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral
rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some
jurisdictions.

### 6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected 

6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may
independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this
Database, including without limitation:

  a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents
  from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for
  purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and
  Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative
  or judicial procedure. 

  b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation
  or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws. 

6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract
and Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated
quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including
creating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the
Contents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or
Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount
to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the
Contents.

### 7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer

7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor &#x22;as is&#x22; and without any
warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,
custom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically
disclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,
non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of
errors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so
this exclusion may not apply to You.

### 8.0 Limitation of liability

8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law,
the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability
for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use
under this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused
by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of
liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental,
consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue,
data, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies
even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and
direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on
the part of the Licensor.

### 9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License

9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License
automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without
notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the
Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative
Databases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You
under this License will not have their licenses terminated provided
their use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted
under Section 4.8 of this License.  Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will
survive any termination of this License.

9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor
will not terminate Your rights under it. 

9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You
for the duration of applicable rights in the Database. 

9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and
conditions of this License, then your full rights under this License
will be reinstated:

  a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th
  day after cessation of breach; 

  b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless
  otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or

  c.  Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the
  violation, this is the first time You have received notice of
  violation of this License from  the Licensor, and You cure the
  violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release
the Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or
making available the Database. Releasing the Database under different
license terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
stated above.

### 10.0 General

10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each
remaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the
fullest extent permitted by law. 

10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any
earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
the Database. 

10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be
entitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any
breach by the Licensor. 

10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by
the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
sought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under
applicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant
jurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License,
these additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the
terms of this License.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mattcg/language-tags.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mattcg/language-tags)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/mattcg/language-tags/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/mattcg/language-tags)

Based on [BCP 47](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) ([RFC 5646](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646)) and the latest [IANA language subtag registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry).

This project will be updated as the standards change.

## JSON data ##

See the [language-subtag-registry](https://github.com/mattcg/language-subtag-registry) project for the underlying JSON data.

## API ##

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var tags = require(&#x27;language-tags&#x27;)
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Note that all lookups and checks for tags and subtags are case insensitive. For formatting according to common conventions, see &#x60;tag.format&#x60;.

### tags(tag) ###

Check whether a hyphen-separated tag is valid and well-formed. Always returns a &#x60;Tag&#x60;, which can be checked using the &#x60;valid&#x60; method.

### tags.check(tag) ###

Shortcut for &#x60;tags(tag).valid()&#x60;. Return &#x60;true&#x60; if the tag is valid, &#x60;false&#x60; otherwise. For meaningful error output see &#x60;tag.errors()&#x60;.

### tags.subtags(subtag), tags.subtags(subtags) ###

Look up one or more subtags. Returns an array of &#x60;Subtag&#x60; objects. Returns an empty array if all of the subtags are non-existent.

Calling &#x60;tags.subtags(&#x27;mt&#x27;)&#x60; will return an array with two &#x60;Subtag&#x60; objects: one for Malta (the &#x27;region&#x27; type subtag) and one for Maltese (the &#x27;language&#x27; type subtag).

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
&#x3E; tags.subtags(&#x27;mt&#x27;);
[Subtag, Subtag]
&#x3E; tags.subtags(&#x27;bumblebee&#x27;);
[]
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

To get or check a single subtag by type use &#x60;tags.language(subtag)&#x60;, &#x60;tags.region(subtag)&#x60; or &#x60;tags.type(subtag, type)&#x60;.

### tags.filter(subtags) ###

The opposite of &#x60;tags.subtags(subtags)&#x60;. Returns an array of codes that are not registered subtags, otherwise returns an empty array.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
&#x3E; tags.filter([&#x27;en&#x27;, &#x27;Aargh&#x27;]);
[&#x27;Aargh&#x27;]
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### tags.search(description, [all]) ###

Search for tags and subtags by description. Supports either a RegExp object or a string for &#x60;description&#x60;. Returns an array of &#x60;Subtag&#x60; and &#x60;Tag&#x60; objects or an empty array if no results were found.

Note that &#x60;Tag&#x60; objects in the results represent &#x27;grandfathered&#x27; or &#x27;redundant&#x27; tags. These are excluded by default. Set the &#x60;all&#x60; parameter to &#x60;true&#x60; to include them.

Search is case-insensitive if &#x60;description&#x60; is a string.

### tags.languages(macrolanguage) ###

      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      &#x22;Source&#x22; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      &#x22;Object&#x22; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &#x22;Work&#x22; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &#x22;Derivative Works&#x22; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &#x22;Contribution&#x22; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &#x22;submitted&#x22;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &#x22;Not a Contribution.&#x22;

      &#x22;Contributor&#x22; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &#x22;NOTICE&#x22; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#x22;AS IS&#x22; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">lru_map</a></h4><pre class="hidden"># Least Recently Used (LRU) cache algorithm

A finite key-value map using the [Least Recently Used (LRU)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#Least_Recently_Used) algorithm, where the most recently-used items are &#x22;kept alive&#x22; while older, less-recently used items are evicted to make room for newer items.

Useful when you want to limit use of memory to only hold commonly-used things.

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/rsms/js-lru.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rsms/js-lru)

## Terminology &#x26; design

- Based on a doubly-linked list for low complexity random shuffling of entries.

- The cache object iself has a &#x22;head&#x22; (least recently used entry) and a
  &#x22;tail&#x22; (most recently used entry).

- The &#x22;oldest&#x22; and &#x22;newest&#x22; are list entries -- an entry might have a &#x22;newer&#x22; and
  an &#x22;older&#x22; entry (doubly-linked, &#x22;older&#x22; being close to &#x22;head&#x22; and &#x22;newer&#x22;
  being closer to &#x22;tail&#x22;).

- Key lookup is done through a key-entry mapping native object, which on most 
  platforms mean &#x60;O(1)&#x60; complexity. This comes at a very low memory cost  (for 
  storing two extra pointers for each entry).

Fancy ASCII art illustration of the general design:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;txt
           entry             entry             entry             entry        
           ______            ______            ______            ______       
          | head |.newer =&#x3E; |      |.newer =&#x3E; |      |.newer =&#x3E; | tail |      
.oldest = |  A   |          |  B   |          |  C   |          |  D   | = .newest
          |______| &#x3C;= older.|______| &#x3C;= older.|______| &#x3C;= older.|______|      
                                                                             
       removed  &#x3C;--  &#x3C;--  &#x3C;--  &#x3C;--  &#x3C;--  &#x3C;--  &#x3C;--  &#x3C;--  &#x3C;--  &#x3C;--  &#x3C;--  added
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## Example

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
let c = new LRUMap(3)
c.set(&#x27;adam&#x27;,   29)
c.set(&#x27;john&#x27;,   26)
c.set(&#x27;angela&#x27;, 24)
c.toString()        // -&#x3E; &#x22;adam:29 &#x3C; john:26 &#x3C; angela:24&#x22;
c.get(&#x27;john&#x27;)       // -&#x3E; 26

// Now &#x27;john&#x27; is the most recently used entry, since we just requested it
c.toString()        // -&#x3E; &#x22;adam:29 &#x3C; angela:24 &#x3C; john:26&#x22;
c.set(&#x27;zorro&#x27;, 141) // -&#x3E; {key:adam, value:29}

// Because we only have room for 3 entries, adding &#x27;zorro&#x27; caused &#x27;adam&#x27;
// to be removed in order to make room for the new entry
c.toString()        // -&#x3E; &#x22;angela:24 &#x3C; john:26 &#x3C; zorro:141&#x22;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

# Usage

**Recommended:** Copy the code in lru.js or copy the lru.js and lru.d.ts files into your source directory. For minimal functionality, you only need the lines up until the comment that says &#x22;Following code is optional&#x22;.

**Using NPM:** [&#x60;yarn add lru_map&#x60;](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lru_map) (note that because NPM is one large flat namespace, you need to import the module as &#x22;lru_map&#x22; rather than simply &#x22;lru&#x22;.)

**Using AMD:** An [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/blob/master/AMD.md#amd) module loader like [&#x60;amdld&#x60;](https://github.com/rsms/js-amdld) can be used to load this module as well. There should be nothing to configure.

**Testing**:

- Run tests with &#x60;npm test&#x60;
- Run benchmarks with &#x60;npm run benchmark&#x60;

**ES compatibility:** This implementation is compatible with modern JavaScript environments and depend on the following features not found in ES5:

- &#x60;const&#x60; and &#x60;let&#x60; keywords
- &#x60;Symbol&#x60; including &#x60;Symbol.iterator&#x60;
- &#x60;Map&#x60;

&#x3E; Note: If you need ES5 compatibility e.g. to use with older browsers, [please use version 2](https://github.com/rsms/js-lru/tree/v2) which has a slightly less feature-full API but is well-tested and about as fast as this implementation.

**Using with TypeScript**

This module comes with complete typing coverage for use with TypeScript. If you copied the code or files rather than using a module loader, make sure to include &#x60;lru.d.ts&#x60; into the same location where you put &#x60;lru.js&#x60;.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;ts
import {LRUMap} from &#x27;./lru&#x27;
// import {LRUMap} from &#x27;lru&#x27;     // when using via AMD
// import {LRUMap} from &#x27;lru_map&#x27; // when using from NPM
console.log(&#x27;LRUMap:&#x27;, LRUMap)
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

# API

The API imitates that of [&#x60;Map&#x60;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map), which means that in most cases you can use &#x60;LRUMap&#x60; as a drop-in replacement for &#x60;Map&#x60;.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;ts
export class LRUMap&#x3C;K,V&#x3E; {
  // Construct a new cache object which will hold up to limit entries.
  // When the size == limit, a &#x60;put&#x60; operation will evict the oldest entry.
  //
  // If &#x60;entries&#x60; is provided, all entries are added to the new map.
  // &#x60;entries&#x60; should be an Array or other iterable object whose elements are
  // key-value pairs (2-element Arrays). Each key-value pair is added to the new Map.
  // null is treated as undefined.
  constructor(limit :number, entries? :Iterable&#x3C;[K,V]&#x3E;);

  // Convenience constructor equivalent to &#x60;new LRUMap(count(entries), entries)&#x60;
  constructor(entries :Iterable&#x3C;[K,V]&#x3E;);

  // Current number of items
  size :number;

  // Maximum number of items this map can hold
  limit :number;

  // Least recently-used entry. Invalidated when map is modified.

  // Replace all values in this map with key-value pairs (2-element Arrays) from
  // provided iterable.
  assign(entries :Iterable&#x3C;[K,V]&#x3E;) : void;

  // Put &#x3C;value&#x3E; into the cache associated with &#x3C;key&#x3E;. Replaces any existing entry
  // with the same key. Returns &#x60;this&#x60;.
  set(key :K, value :V) : LRUMap&#x3C;K,V&#x3E;;

  // Purge the least recently used (oldest) entry from the cache.
  // Returns the removed entry or undefined if the cache was empty.
  shift() : [K,V] | undefined;

  // Get and register recent use of &#x3C;key&#x3E;.
  // Returns the value associated with &#x3C;key&#x3E; or undefined if not in cache.

  // Access value for &#x3C;key&#x3E; without registering recent use. Useful if you do not
  // want to chage the state of the map, but only &#x22;peek&#x22; at it.
  // Returns the value associated with &#x3C;key&#x3E; if found, or undefined if not found.
  find(key :K) : V | undefined;

  // Remove entry &#x3C;key&#x3E; from cache and return its value.
  // Returns the removed value, or undefined if not found.
  delete(key :K) : V | undefined;

  // Removes all entries
  clear() : void;

  // Returns an iterator over all keys, starting with the oldest.
  keys() : Iterator&#x3C;K&#x3E;;

  // Returns an iterator over all values, starting with the oldest.
  values() : Iterator&#x3C;V&#x3E;;

  // Returns an iterator over all entries, starting with the oldest.
  entries() : Iterator&#x3C;[K,V]&#x3E;;

  // Returns an iterator over all entries, starting with the oldest.
  [Symbol.iterator]() : Iterator&#x3C;[K,V]&#x3E;;

  // Call &#x60;fun&#x60; for each entry, starting with the oldest entry.

  // Returns an object suitable for JSON encoding
  toJSON() : Array&#x3C;{key :K, value :V}&#x3E;;

  // Returns a human-readable text representation
  toString() : string;
}

// An entry holds the key and value, and pointers to any older and newer entries.
// Entries might hold references to adjacent entries in the internal linked-list.
// Therefore you should never store or modify Entry objects. Instead, reference the
// key and value of an entry when needed.
interface Entry&#x3C;K,V&#x3E; {
  key   :K;
  value :V;
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

If you need to perform any form of finalization of items as they are evicted from the cache, wrapping the &#x60;shift&#x60; method is a good way to do it:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
let c = new LRUMap(123);
c.shift = function() {
  let entry = LRUMap.prototype.shift.call(this);
  doSomethingWith(entry);
  return entry;
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

The internals calls &#x60;shift&#x60; as entries need to be evicted, so this method is guaranteed to be called for any item that&#x27;s removed from the cache. The returned entry must not include any strong references to other entries. See note in the documentation of &#x60;LRUMap.prototype.set()&#x60;.

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">mdn-data</a></h4><pre class="hidden">CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &#x22;owner&#x22;) of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a &#x22;Work&#x22;).

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works (&#x22;Commons&#x22;) that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the &#x22;Affirmer&#x22;), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (&#x22;Copyright and
Related Rights&#x22;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
  and translate a Work;

  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person&#x27;s image or likeness
  depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
  a Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer&#x27;s Copyright
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#x22;Waiver&#x22;). Affirmer makes
the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
detriment of Affirmer&#x27;s heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
by the public as contemplated by Affirmer&#x27;s express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer&#x27;s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
unconditional license to exercise Affirmer&#x27;s Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
promotional purposes (the &#x22;License&#x22;). The License shall be deemed effective as
of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
Affirmer&#x27;s express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
  any person&#x27;s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
  or other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
  CC0 or use of the Work.

Natural Compare &#x26;ndash; [![Build][]][1] [![Coverage][]][2]
===============

Compare strings containing a mix of letters and numbers
in the way a human being would in sort order.
This is described as a &#x22;natural ordering&#x22;.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;text
Standard sorting:   Natural order sorting:
    img1.png            img1.png
    img10.png           img2.png
    img12.png           img10.png
    img2.png            img12.png
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

String.naturalCompare returns a number indicating
whether a reference string comes before or after or is the same
as the given string in sort order.
Use it with builtin sort() function.



### Installation

- In browser

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html
&#x3C;script src=min.natural-compare.js&#x3E;&#x3C;/script&#x3E;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

- In node.js: &#x60;npm install natural-compare-lite&#x60;

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
require(&#x22;natural-compare-lite&#x22;)
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### Usage

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
// Simple case sensitive example
var a = [&#x22;z1.doc&#x22;, &#x22;z10.doc&#x22;, &#x22;z17.doc&#x22;, &#x22;z2.doc&#x22;, &#x22;z23.doc&#x22;, &#x22;z3.doc&#x22;];
a.sort(String.naturalCompare);
// [&#x22;z1.doc&#x22;, &#x22;z2.doc&#x22;, &#x22;z3.doc&#x22;, &#x22;z10.doc&#x22;, &#x22;z17.doc&#x22;, &#x22;z23.doc&#x22;]

// Use wrapper function for case insensitivity
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.toLowerCase(), b.toLowerCase());
})

// In most cases we want to sort an array of objects
var a = [ {&#x22;street&#x22;:&#x22;350 5th Ave&#x22;, &#x22;room&#x22;:&#x22;A-1021&#x22;}
        , {&#x22;street&#x22;:&#x22;350 5th Ave&#x22;, &#x22;room&#x22;:&#x22;A-21046-b&#x22;} ];

// sort by street, then by room
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.street, b.street) || String.naturalCompare(a.room, b.room);
})

// When text transformation is needed (eg toLowerCase()),
// it is best for performance to keep
// transformed key in that object.
// There are no need to do text transformation
// on each comparision when sorting.
var a = [ {&#x22;make&#x22;:&#x22;Audi&#x22;, &#x22;model&#x22;:&#x22;A6&#x22;}
        , {&#x22;make&#x22;:&#x22;Kia&#x22;,  &#x22;model&#x22;:&#x22;Rio&#x22;} ];

// sort by make, then by model
a.map(function(car){
  car.sort_key = (car.make + &#x22; &#x22; + car.model).toLowerCase();
})
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.sort_key, b.sort_key);
})
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

- Works well with dates in ISO format eg &#x22;Rev 2012-07-26.doc&#x22;.


### Custom alphabet

It is possible to configure a custom alphabet
to achieve a desired order.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
// Estonian alphabet
String.alphabet = &#x22;ABDEFGHIJKLMNOPRS&#x160;Z&#x17D;TUV&#xD5;&#xC4;&#xD6;&#xDC;XYabdefghijklmnoprs&#x161;z&#x17E;tuv&#xF5;&#xE4;&#xF6;&#xFC;xy&#x22;
[&#x22;t&#x22;, &#x22;z&#x22;, &#x22;x&#x22;, &#x22;&#xF5;&#x22;].sort(String.naturalCompare)
// [&#x22;z&#x22;, &#x22;t&#x22;, &#x22;&#xF5;&#x22;, &#x22;x&#x22;]

// Russian alphabet
String.alphabet = &#x22;&#x410;&#x411;&#x412;&#x413;&#x414;&#x415;&#x401;&#x416;&#x417;&#x418;&#x419;&#x41A;&#x41B;&#x41C;&#x41D;&#x41E;&#x41F;&#x420;&#x421;&#x422;&#x423;&#x424;&#x425;&#x426;&#x427;&#x428;&#x429;&#x42A;&#x42B;&#x42C;&#x42D;&#x42E;&#x42F;&#x430;&#x431;&#x432;&#x433;&#x434;&#x435;&#x451;&#x436;&#x437;&#x438;&#x439;&#x43A;&#x43B;&#x43C;&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x43F;&#x440;&#x441;&#x442;&#x443;&#x444;&#x445;&#x446;&#x447;&#x448;&#x449;&#x44A;&#x44B;&#x44C;&#x44D;&#x44E;&#x44F;&#x22;
[&#x22;&#x401;&#x22;, &#x22;&#x410;&#x22;, &#x22;&#x411;&#x22;].sort(String.naturalCompare)
// [&#x22;&#x410;&#x22;, &#x22;&#x411;&#x22;, &#x22;&#x401;&#x22;]
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

&#x22;Work&#x22; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

&#x22;Derivative Works&#x22; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

&#x22;Contribution&#x22; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &#x22;submitted&#x22; means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as &#x22;Not a Contribution.&#x22;

&#x22;Contributor&#x22; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a &#x22;NOTICE&#x22; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#x22;AS IS&#x22; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &#x22;Contribution&#x22; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &#x22;submitted&#x22;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &#x22;Not a Contribution.&#x22;

      &#x22;Contributor&#x22; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &#x22;NOTICE&#x22; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#x22;AS IS&#x22; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pnp-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnp-webpack-plugin)
[![node version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/pnp-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnp-webpack-plugin)

*This plugin is also available for Jest ([jest-pnp-resolver](https://github.com/arcanis/jest-pnp-resolver)), Rollup ([rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve](https://github.com/arcanis/rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve)), and TypeScript ([ts-pnp](https://github.com/arcanis/ts-pnp))*

## Installation

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
yarn add -D pnp-webpack-plugin
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## Usage

Simply add the plugin to both the &#x60;resolver&#x60; and &#x60;resolveLoader&#x60;:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const PnpWebpackPlugin = require(&#x60;pnp-webpack-plugin&#x60;);

module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    plugins: [
      PnpWebpackPlugin,
    ],
  },
  resolveLoader: {
    plugins: [
      PnpWebpackPlugin.moduleLoader(module),
    ],
  },
};
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

The &#x60;resolve&#x60; entry will take care of correctly resolving the dependencies required by your program, and the &#x60;resolveLoader&#x60; entry will help Webpack find the location of the loaders on the disk. Note that in this case, all loaders will be resolved relative to the package containing your configuration.

In case part of your configuration comes from third-party packages that use their own loaders, make sure they use &#x60;require.resolve&#x60; - this will ensure that the resolution process is portable accross environments (including when Plug&#x27;n&#x27;Play isn&#x27;t enabled), and prevent it from relying on undefined behaviors:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [{
      test: /\.js$/,
      loader: require.resolve(&#x27;babel-loader&#x27;),
    }]
  },
};
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### &#x60;ts-loader&#x60; integration

This plugin as an integration to easily add support for TypeScript in your applications through &#x60;ts-loader&#x60;. In order to do this, just do the following:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const PnpWebpackPlugin = require(&#x60;pnp-webpack-plugin&#x60;);

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [{
      test: /\.ts$/,
      loader: require.resolve(&#x27;ts-loader&#x27;),
      options: PnpWebpackPlugin.tsLoaderOptions({
        // ... regular options go there ...
      }),
    }],
  },
};
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

If you have any options you want to pass to &#x60;ts-loader&#x60;, just pass them as parameter of the &#x60;tsLoaderOptions&#x60; function and it will take care of forwarding them properly.

## &#x60;fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin&#x60; integration

We also provide an integration for &#x60;fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin&#x60;, in a similar way to what we do with &#x60;ts-loader&#x60;. Here&#x27;s an example:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin = require(&#x60;fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin&#x60;);
const PnpWebpackPlugin = require(&#x60;pnp-webpack-plugin&#x60;);

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin(PnpWebpackPlugin.forkTsCheckerOptions({
      // ... regular options go there ...
    }),
  ],
};
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

&#x3C;!-- &#x1F6A8; HEY! HERE BEGINS THE INTERESTING STUFF &#x1F6A8; --&#x3E;

## Wut? Poppers?

A popper is an element on the screen which &#x22;pops out&#x22; from the natural flow of your application.  
Common examples of poppers are tooltips, popovers and drop-downs.


## So, yet another tooltip library?

Well, basically, **no**.  
Popper.js is a **positioning engine**, its purpose is to calculate the position of an element
to make it possible to position it near a given reference element.  

The engine is completely modular and most of its features are implemented as **modifiers**
(similar to middlewares or plugins).  
The whole code base is written in ES2015 and its features are automatically tested on real browsers thanks to [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/).

Popper.js has zero dependencies. No jQuery, no LoDash, nothing.  
It&#x27;s used by big companies like [Twitter in Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Microsoft in WebClipper](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/WebClipper) and [Atlassian in AtlasKit](https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/atlaskit/registry/).

### Popper.js

This is the engine, the library that computes and, optionally, applies the styles to
the poppers.

Some of the key points are:

- Position elements keeping them in their original DOM context (doesn&#x27;t mess with your DOM!);
- Allows to export the computed informations to integrate with React and other view libraries;
- Supports Shadow DOM elements;
- Completely customizable thanks to the modifiers based structure;

Visit our [project page](https://fezvrasta.github.io/popper.js) to see a lot of examples of what you can do with Popper.js!

Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md).


### Tooltip.js

Since lots of users just need a simple way to integrate powerful tooltips in their projects,
we created **Tooltip.js**.  
It&#x27;s a small library that makes it easy to automatically create tooltips using as engine Popper.js.  
Its API is almost identical to the famous tooltip system of Bootstrap, in this way it will be
easy to integrate it in your projects.  
The tooltips generated by Tooltip.js are accessible thanks to the &#x60;aria&#x60; tags.

Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/tooltip-documentation.md).


## Installation
Popper.js is available on the following package managers and CDNs:

| Source |                                                                                  |
|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| npm    | &#x60;npm install popper.js --save&#x60;                                                   |
| yarn   | &#x60;yarn add popper.js&#x60;                                                             |
| NuGet  | &#x60;PM&#x3E; Install-Package popper.js&#x60;                                                  |
| Bower  | &#x60;bower install popper.js --save&#x60;                     |
| unpkg  | [&#x60;https://unpkg.com/popper.js&#x60;](https://unpkg.com/popper.js)                     |
| cdnjs  | [&#x60;https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js&#x60;](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |

Tooltip.js as well:

| Source |                                                                                  |
|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| npm    | &#x60;npm install tooltip.js --save&#x60;                                                  |
| yarn   | &#x60;yarn add tooltip.js&#x60;                                                            |
| Bower* | &#x60;bower install tooltip.js=https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js --save&#x60;                   |
| unpkg  | [&#x60;https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js&#x60;](https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js)                   |
| cdnjs  | [&#x60;https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js&#x60;](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |

\*: Bower isn&#x27;t officially supported, it can be used to install Tooltip.js only trough the unpkg.com CDN. This method has the limitation of not being able to define a specific version of the library. Bower and Popper.js suggests to use npm or Yarn for your projects.  
For more info, [read the related issue](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/390).

### Dist targets

Popper.js is currently shipped with 3 targets in mind: UMD, ESM and ESNext.

- UMD - Universal Module Definition: AMD, RequireJS and globals;
- ESM - ES Modules: For webpack/Rollup or browser supporting the spec;
- ESNext: Available in &#x60;dist/&#x60;, can be used with webpack and &#x60;babel-preset-env&#x60;;

Make sure to use the right one for your needs. If you want to import it with a &#x60;&#x3C;script&#x3E;&#x60; tag, use UMD.

## Usage

Given an existing popper DOM node, ask Popper.js to position it near its button

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var reference = document.querySelector(&#x27;.my-button&#x27;);
var popper = document.querySelector(&#x27;.my-popper&#x27;);
var anotherPopper = new Popper(
    reference,
    popper,
    {
        // popper options here
    }
);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### Callbacks

Popper.js supports two kinds of callbacks, the &#x60;onCreate&#x60; callback is called after
the popper has been initialized. The &#x60;onUpdate&#x60; one is called on any subsequent update.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const reference = document.querySelector(&#x27;.my-button&#x27;);
const popper = document.querySelector(&#x27;.my-popper&#x27;);
new Popper(reference, popper, {
    onCreate: (data) =&#x3E; {
        // data is an object containing all the informations computed
        // by Popper.js and used to style the popper and its arrow
        // The complete description is available in Popper.js documentation
    },
    onUpdate: (data) =&#x3E; {
        // same as &#x60;onCreate&#x60; but called on subsequent updates
    }
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### Writing your own modifiers

Popper.js is based on a &#x22;plugin-like&#x22; architecture, most of its features are fully encapsulated &#x22;modifiers&#x22;.  
A modifier is a function that is called each time Popper.js needs to compute the position of the popper. For this reason, modifiers should be very performant to avoid bottlenecks.  

To learn how to create a modifier, [read the modifiers documentation](docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md#modifiers--object)


### React, Vue.js, Angular, AngularJS, Ember.js (etc...) integration

Integrating 3rd party libraries in React or other libraries can be a pain because
they usually alter the DOM and drive the libraries crazy.  
Popper.js limits all its DOM modifications inside the &#x60;applyStyle&#x60; modifier,
you can simply disable it and manually apply the popper coordinates using
your library of choice.  

For a comprehensive list of libraries that let you use Popper.js into existing
frameworks, visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page.

Alternatively, you may even override your own &#x60;applyStyles&#x60; with your custom one and
integrate Popper.js by yourself!

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
function applyReactStyle(data) {
    // export data in your framework and use its content to apply the style to your popper
};

const reference = document.querySelector(&#x27;.my-button&#x27;);
const popper = document.querySelector(&#x27;.my-popper&#x27;);
new Popper(reference, popper, {
    modifiers: {
        applyStyle: { enabled: false },
        applyReactStyle: {
            enabled: true,
            fn: applyReactStyle,
            order: 800,
        },
    },
});

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### Migration from Popper.js v0

Since the API changed, we prepared some migration instructions to make it easy to upgrade to
Popper.js v1.  

https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/62

Feel free to comment inside the issue if you have any questions.

### Performances

Popper.js is very performant. It usually takes 0.5ms to compute a popper&#x27;s position (on an iMac with 3.5G GHz Intel Core i5).  
This means that it will not cause any [jank](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool/anatomy-of-jank), leading to a smooth user experience.

## Notes

### Libraries using Popper.js

The aim of Popper.js is to provide a stable and powerful positioning engine ready to
be used in 3rd party libraries.  

Visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page for an updated list of projects.

## Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &#x201C;owner&#x201D;) of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a &#x201C;Work&#x201D;).

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
(&#x201C;Commons&#x201D;) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the &#x201C;Affirmer&#x201D;), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (&#x201C;Copyright and
   Related Rights&#x201D;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:
   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
      and translate a Work;
   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person&#x2019;s image or likeness
      depicted in a Work;
   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
      a Work;
   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
      thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer&#x2019;s Copyright
   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#x201C;Waiver&#x201D;). Affirmer
   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
   to the detriment of Affirmer&#x2019;s heirs and successors, fully intending that
   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer&#x2019;s express
   Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
   Affirmer&#x2019;s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer&#x2019;s Copyright and
   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#x201C;License&#x201D;). The License
   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
   in either case contrary to Affirmer&#x2019;s express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
      extent permissible under applicable law.
   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
      limitation any person&#x2019;s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
      CC0 or use of the Work.

Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (&#x201C;Copyright and
   Related Rights&#x201D;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:
   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
      and translate a Work;
   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person&#x2019;s image or likeness
      depicted in a Work;

      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
      a Work;
   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
      thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer&#x2019;s Copyright
   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#x201C;Waiver&#x201D;). Affirmer
   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
   to the detriment of Affirmer&#x2019;s heirs and successors, fully intending that
   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer&#x2019;s express
   Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
   Affirmer&#x2019;s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer&#x2019;s Copyright and
   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the

   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#x201C;License&#x201D;). The License
   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
   in either case contrary to Affirmer&#x2019;s express Statement of Purpose.

      extent permissible under applicable law.
   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
      limitation any person&#x2019;s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.

## Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &#x201C;owner&#x201D;) of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a &#x201C;Work&#x201D;).

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
(&#x201C;Commons&#x201D;) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the &#x201C;Affirmer&#x201D;), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal

   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person&#x2019;s image or likeness

   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
      a Work;
   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal

   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#x201C;Waiver&#x201D;). Affirmer
   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
   to the detriment of Affirmer&#x2019;s heirs and successors, fully intending that

(&#x201C;Commons&#x201D;) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the &#x201C;Affirmer&#x201D;), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (&#x201C;Copyright and
   Related Rights&#x201D;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:
   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
      and translate a Work;
   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person&#x2019;s image or likeness
      depicted in a Work;
   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
      a Work;
   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
      thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer&#x2019;s Copyright
   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#x201C;Waiver&#x201D;). Affirmer
   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
   to the detriment of Affirmer&#x2019;s heirs and successors, fully intending that
   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer&#x2019;s express
   Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
   Affirmer&#x2019;s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer&#x2019;s Copyright and
   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#x201C;License&#x201D;). The License
   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
   in either case contrary to Affirmer&#x2019;s express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
      extent permissible under applicable law.
   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
      limitation any person&#x2019;s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
      CC0 or use of the Work.

## Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &#x201C;owner&#x201D;) of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a &#x201C;Work&#x201D;).

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
(&#x201C;Commons&#x201D;) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a

   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person&#x2019;s image or likeness
      depicted in a Work;
   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
      a Work;
   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal

   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#x201C;Waiver&#x201D;). Affirmer
   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
   to the detriment of Affirmer&#x2019;s heirs and successors, fully intending that
   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,

   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
      and translate a Work;
   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person&#x2019;s image or likeness
      depicted in a Work;
   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
      a Work;
   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
      thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer&#x2019;s Copyright
   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#x201C;Waiver&#x201D;). Affirmer
   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
   to the detriment of Affirmer&#x2019;s heirs and successors, fully intending that
   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer&#x2019;s express
   Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
   Affirmer&#x2019;s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer&#x2019;s Copyright and
   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#x201C;License&#x201D;). The License
   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
   in either case contrary to Affirmer&#x2019;s express Statement of Purpose.

[![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/postcss-media-query-parser.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-media-query-parser) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dryoma/postcss-media-query-parser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dryoma/postcss-media-query-parser)

Media query parser with very simple traversing functionality.

## Installation and usage

First install it via NPM:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
npm install postcss-media-query-parser
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Then in your Node.js application:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import mediaParser from &#x22;postcss-media-query-parser&#x22;;

const mediaQueryString = &#x22;(max-width: 100px), not print&#x22;;
const result = mediaParser(mediaQueryString);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

The &#x60;result&#x60; will be this object:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
{
  type: &#x27;media-query-list&#x27;,
  value: &#x27;(max-width: 100px), not print&#x27;,
  after: &#x27;&#x27;,
  before: &#x27;&#x27;,
  sourceIndex: 0,

  // the first media query
  nodes: [{
    type: &#x27;media-query&#x27;,
    value: &#x27;(max-width: 100px)&#x27;,
    before: &#x27;&#x27;,
    after: &#x27;&#x27;,
    sourceIndex: 0,
    parent: &#x3C;link to parent &#x27;media-query-list&#x27; node&#x3E;,
    nodes: [{
      type: &#x27;media-feature-expression&#x27;,
      value: &#x27;(max-width: 100px)&#x27;,
      before: &#x27;&#x27;,
      after: &#x27;&#x27;,
      sourceIndex: 0,
      parent: &#x3C;link to parent &#x27;media-query&#x27; node&#x3E;,
      nodes: [{
        type: &#x27;media-feature&#x27;,
        value: &#x27;max-width&#x27;,
        before: &#x27;&#x27;,
        after: &#x27;&#x27;,
        sourceIndex: 1,
        parent: &#x3C;link to parent &#x27;media-feature-expression&#x27; node&#x3E;,
      }, {
        type: &#x27;colon&#x27;,
        value: &#x27;:&#x27;,
        before: &#x27;&#x27;,
        after: &#x27; &#x27;,
        sourceIndex: 10,
        parent: &#x3C;link to parent &#x27;media-feature-expression&#x27; node&#x3E;,
      }, {
        type: &#x27;value&#x27;,
        value: &#x27;100px&#x27;,
        before: &#x27; &#x27;,
        after: &#x27;&#x27;,
        sourceIndex: 12,
        parent: &#x3C;link to parent &#x27;media-feature-expression&#x27; node&#x3E;,
      }]
    }]
  },
  // the second media query
  {
    type: &#x27;media-query&#x27;,
    value: &#x27;not print&#x27;,
    before: &#x27; &#x27;,
    after: &#x27;&#x27;,
    sourceIndex: 20,
    parent: &#x3C;link to parent &#x27;media-query-list&#x27; node&#x3E;,
    nodes: [{
      type: &#x27;keyword&#x27;,
      value: &#x27;not&#x27;,
      before: &#x27; &#x27;,
      after: &#x27; &#x27;,
      sourceIndex: 20,
      parent: &#x3C;link to parent &#x27;media-query&#x27; node&#x3E;,
    }, {
      type: &#x27;media-type&#x27;,
      value: &#x27;print&#x27;,
      before: &#x27; &#x27;,
      after: &#x27;&#x27;,
      sourceIndex: 24,
      parent: &#x3C;link to parent &#x27;media-query&#x27; node&#x3E;,
    }]
  }]
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

One of the likely sources of a string to parse would be traversing [a PostCSS container node](http://api.postcss.org/Root.html) and getting the &#x60;params&#x60; property of nodes with the name of &#x22;atRule&#x22;:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import postcss from &#x22;postcss&#x22;;
import mediaParser from &#x22;postcss-media-query-parser&#x22;;

const root = postcss.parse(&#x3C;contents&#x3E;);
// ... or any other way to get sucn container

root.walkAtRules(&#x22;media&#x22;, (atRule) =&#x3E; {
  const mediaParsed = mediaParser(atRule.params);
  // Do something with &#x22;mediaParsed&#x22; object
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## Nodes

Node is a very generic item in terms of this parser. It&#x27;s is pretty much everything that ends up in the parsed result. Each node has these properties:

* &#x60;type&#x60;: the type of the node (see below);
* &#x60;value&#x60;: the node&#x27;s value stripped of trailing whitespaces;
* &#x60;sourceIndex&#x60;: 0-based index of the node start relative to the source start (excluding trailing whitespaces);
* &#x60;before&#x60;: a string that contain a whitespace between the node start and the previous node end/source start;
* &#x60;after&#x60;: a string that contain a whitespace between the node end and the next node start/source end;
* &#x60;parent&#x60;: a link to this node&#x27;s parent node (a container).

A node can have one of these types (according to [the 2012 CSS3 standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-css3-mediaqueries-20120619/)):

* &#x60;media-query-list&#x60;: that is the root level node of the parsing result. A [container](#containers); its children can have types of &#x60;url&#x60; and &#x60;media-query&#x60;.
* &#x60;url&#x60;: if a source is taken from a CSS &#x60;@import&#x60; rule, it will have a &#x60;url(...)&#x60; function call. The value of such node will be &#x60;url(http://uri-address)&#x60;, it is to be parsed separately.
* &#x60;media-query&#x60;: such nodes correspond to each media query in a comma separated list. In the exapmle above there are two. Nodes of this type are [containers](#containers).
* &#x60;media-type&#x60;: &#x60;screen&#x60;, &#x60;tv&#x60; and other media types.
* &#x60;keyword&#x60;: &#x60;only&#x60;, &#x60;not&#x60; or &#x60;and&#x60; keyword.
* &#x60;media-feature-expression&#x60;: an expression in parentheses that checks for a condition of a particular media feature. The value would be like this: &#x60;(max-width: 1000px)&#x60;. Such nodes are [containers](#containers). They always have a &#x60;media-feature&#x60; child node, but might not have a &#x60;value&#x60; child node (like in &#x60;screen and (color)&#x60;).
* &#x60;media-feature&#x60;: a media feature, e.g. &#x60;max-width&#x60;.
* &#x60;colon&#x60;: present if a media feature expression has a colon (e.g. &#x60;(min-width: 1000px)&#x60;, compared to &#x60;(color)&#x60;).
* &#x60;value&#x60;: a media feature expression value, e.g. &#x60;100px&#x60; in &#x60;(max-width: 1000px)&#x60;.

### Parsing details

postcss-media-query-parser allows for cases of some **non-standard syntaxes** and tries its best to work them around. For example, in a media query from a code with SCSS syntax:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scss
@media #{$media-type} and ( #{&#x22;max-width&#x22; + &#x22;: 10px&#x22;} ) { ... }
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

&#x60;#{$media-type}&#x60; will be the node of type &#x60;media-type&#x60;, alghough &#x60;$media-type&#x60;&#x27;s value can be &#x60;only screen&#x60;. And inside &#x60;media-feature-expression&#x60; there will only be a &#x60;media-feature&#x60; type node with the value of &#x60;#{&#x22;max-width&#x22; + &#x22;: 10px&#x22;}&#x60; (this example doesn&#x27;t make much sense, it&#x27;s for demo purpose).

But the result of parsing **malformed media queries** (such as with incorrect amount of closing parens, curly braces, etc.) can be unexpected. For exapmle, parsing:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scss
@media ((min-width: -100px)
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

would return a media query list with the single &#x60;media-query&#x60; node that has no child nodes.

## Containers

Containers are [nodes](#nodes) that have other nodes as children. Container nodes have an additional property &#x60;nodes&#x60; which is an array of their child nodes. And also these methods:

* &#x60;each(callback)&#x60; - traverses the direct child nodes of a container, calling &#x60;callback&#x60; function for each of them. Returns &#x60;false&#x60; if traversing has stopped by means of &#x60;callback&#x60; returning &#x60;false&#x60;, and &#x60;true&#x60; otherwise.
* &#x60;walk([filter, ]callback)&#x60; - traverses ALL descendant nodes of a container, calling &#x60;callback&#x60; function for each of them. Returns &#x60;false&#x60; if traversing has stopped by means of &#x60;callback&#x60; returning &#x60;false&#x60;, and &#x60;true&#x60; otherwise.

In both cases &#x60;callback&#x60; takes these parameters:

- &#x60;node&#x60; - the current node (one of the container&#x27;s descendats, that the callback has been called against).
- &#x60;i&#x60; - 0-based index of the &#x60;node&#x60; in an array of its parent&#x27;s children.
- &#x60;nodes&#x60; - array of child nodes of &#x60;node&#x60;&#x27;s parent.

If &#x60;callback&#x60; returns &#x60;false&#x60;, the traversing stops.

## Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &#x201C;owner&#x201D;) of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a &#x201C;Work&#x201D;).

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
(&#x201C;Commons&#x201D;) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the &#x201C;Affirmer&#x201D;), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (&#x201C;Copyright and
   Related Rights&#x201D;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:
   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
      and translate a Work;
   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person&#x2019;s image or likeness
      depicted in a Work;
   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
      a Work;
   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
      thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer&#x2019;s Copyright
   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#x201C;Waiver&#x201D;). Affirmer
   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
   to the detriment of Affirmer&#x2019;s heirs and successors, fully intending that
   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer&#x2019;s express
   Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
   Affirmer&#x2019;s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer&#x2019;s Copyright and
   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation

## Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &#x201C;owner&#x201D;) of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a &#x201C;Work&#x201D;).

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
(&#x201C;Commons&#x201D;) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the &#x201C;Affirmer&#x201D;), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (&#x201C;Copyright and
   Related Rights&#x201D;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:
   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
      and translate a Work;
   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person&#x2019;s image or likeness
      depicted in a Work;
   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
      a Work;
   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
      thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer&#x2019;s Copyright
   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#x201C;Waiver&#x201D;). Affirmer
   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
   to the detriment of Affirmer&#x2019;s heirs and successors, fully intending that
   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer&#x2019;s express
   Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
   Affirmer&#x2019;s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer&#x2019;s Copyright and
   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#x201C;License&#x201D;). The License
   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
   in either case contrary to Affirmer&#x2019;s express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
      extent permissible under applicable law.
   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
      limitation any person&#x2019;s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
      CC0 or use of the Work.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      &#x22;License&#x22; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      &#x22;Licensor&#x22; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      &#x22;Legal Entity&#x22; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      &#x22;control&#x22; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      &#x22;You&#x22; (or &#x22;Your&#x22;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      &#x22;Source&#x22; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      &#x22;Object&#x22; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &#x22;Work&#x22; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &#x22;Derivative Works&#x22; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &#x22;Contribution&#x22; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &#x22;submitted&#x22;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &#x22;Not a Contribution.&#x22;

      &#x22;Contributor&#x22; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &#x22;NOTICE&#x22; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#x22;AS IS&#x22; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &#x22;NOTICE&#x22; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#x22;AS IS&#x22; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">react-router-dom</a></h4><pre class="hidden"># react-router-dom

DOM bindings for [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router).

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save react-router-dom

Then with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
// using ES6 modules
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Link } from &#x27;react-router-dom&#x27;

// using CommonJS modules
const BrowserRouter = require(&#x27;react-router-dom&#x27;).BrowserRouter
const Route = require(&#x27;react-router-dom&#x27;).Route
const Link = require(&#x27;react-router-dom&#x27;).Link
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

The UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html
&#x3C;script src=&#x22;https://unpkg.com/react-router-dom/umd/react-router-dom.min.js&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;/script&#x3E;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

You can find the library on &#x60;window.ReactRouterDOM&#x60;.

## Issues

If you find a bug, please file an issue on [our issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues).

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">react-router</a></h4><pre class="hidden"># react-router

Declarative routing for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react).

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save react-router

**Note:** This package provides the core routing functionality for React Router, but you might not want to install it directly. If you are writing an application that will run in the browser, you should instead install &#x60;react-router-dom&#x60;. Similarly, if you are writing a React Native application, you should instead install &#x60;react-router-native&#x60;. Both of those will install &#x60;react-router&#x60; as a dependency.


Then with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
// using ES6 modules
import { Router, Route, Switch } from &#x27;react-router&#x27;

// using CommonJS modules
var Router = require(&#x27;react-router&#x27;).Router
var Route = require(&#x27;react-router&#x27;).Route
var Switch = require(&#x27;react-router&#x27;).Switch

# React-Select

The Select control for [React](https://reactjs.com). Initially built for use in [KeystoneJS](http://www.keystonejs.com).

See [react-select.com](https://www.react-select.com) for live demos and comprehensive docs.

See our [upgrade guide](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/3585) for a breakdown on how to upgrade from v2 to v3.

React Select is funded by [Thinkmill](https://www.thinkmill.com.au) and [Atlassian](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com). It represents a whole new approach to developing powerful React.js components that _just work_ out of the box, while being extremely customisable.

Features include:

- Flexible approach to data, with customisable functions
- Extensible styling API with [emotion](https://emotion.sh)
- Component Injection API for complete control over the UI behaviour
- Controllable state props and modular architecture
- Long-requested features like option groups, portal support, animation, and more

If you&#x27;re interested in the background, watch Jed&#x27;s [talk on React Select](https://youtu.be/Eb2wy-HNGMo) at ReactNYC in March 2018.

See our [upgrade guide](https://react-select.com/upgrade-guide) for a breakdown on how to upgrade from v1 to v2.

The old docs and examples will continue to be available at [v1.react-select.com](https://v1.react-select.com).

# Installation and usage

The easiest way to use react-select is to install it from npm and build it into your app with Webpack.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
yarn add react-select
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Then use it in your app:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import Select from &#x27;react-select&#x27;;

const options = [
  { value: &#x27;chocolate&#x27;, label: &#x27;Chocolate&#x27; },
  { value: &#x27;strawberry&#x27;, label: &#x27;Strawberry&#x27; },
  { value: &#x27;vanilla&#x27;, label: &#x27;Vanilla&#x27; },
];

class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    selectedOption: null,
  };
  handleChange = selectedOption =&#x3E; {
    this.setState({ selectedOption });
    console.log(&#x60;Option selected:&#x60;, selectedOption);
  };
  render() {
    const { selectedOption } = this.state;

    return (
      &#x3C;Select
        value={selectedOption}
        onChange={this.handleChange}
        options={options}
      /&#x3E;
    );
  }
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## Props

Common props you may want to specify include:

- &#x60;autoFocus&#x60; - focus the control when it mounts
- &#x60;className&#x60; - apply a className to the control
- &#x60;classNamePrefix&#x60; - apply classNames to inner elements with the given prefix
- &#x60;isDisabled&#x60; - disable the control
- &#x60;isMulti&#x60; - allow the user to select multiple values
- &#x60;isSearchable&#x60; - allow the user to search for matching options
- &#x60;name&#x60; - generate an HTML input with this name, containing the current value
- &#x60;onChange&#x60; - subscribe to change events
- &#x60;options&#x60; - specify the options the user can select from
- &#x60;placeholder&#x60; - change the text displayed when no option is selected
- &#x60;value&#x60; - control the current value

See the [props documentation](https://www.react-select.com/props) for complete documentation on the props react-select supports.

## Controllable Props

You can control the following props by providing values for them. If you don&#x27;t, react-select will manage them for you.

- &#x60;value&#x60; / &#x60;onChange&#x60; - specify the current value of the control
- &#x60;menuIsOpen&#x60; / &#x60;onMenuOpen&#x60; / &#x60;onMenuClose&#x60; - control whether the menu is open
- &#x60;inputValue&#x60; / &#x60;onInputChange&#x60; - control the value of the search input (changing this will update the available options)

If you don&#x27;t provide these props, you can set the initial value of the state they control:

- &#x60;defaultValue&#x60; - set the initial value of the control
- &#x60;defaultMenuIsOpen&#x60; - set the initial open value of the menu
- &#x60;defaultInputValue&#x60; - set the initial value of the search input

## Methods

React-select exposes two public methods:

- &#x60;focus()&#x60; - focus the control programatically
- &#x60;blur()&#x60; - blur the control programatically

## Customisation

Check the docs for more information on:

- [Customising the styles](https://www.react-select.com/styles)
- [Using custom components](https://www.react-select.com/components)
- [Using the built-in animated components](https://www.react-select.com/home#animated-components)

Standalone runtime for
[Regenerator](https://github.com/facebook/regenerator)-compiled generator
and &#x60;async&#x60; functions.

To import the runtime as a module (recommended), either of the following
import styles will work:
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
// CommonJS
const regeneratorRuntime = require(&#x22;regenerator-runtime&#x22;);

// ECMAScript 2015
import regeneratorRuntime from &#x22;regenerator-runtime&#x22;;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

To ensure that &#x60;regeneratorRuntime&#x60; is defined globally, either of the
following styles will work:
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
// CommonJS
require(&#x22;regenerator-runtime/runtime&#x22;);

// ECMAScript 2015
import &#x22;regenerator-runtime/runtime&#x22;;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

To get the absolute file system path of &#x60;runtime.js&#x60;, evaluate the
following expression:
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
require(&#x22;regenerator-runtime/path&#x22;).path

## API

### &#x60;processor.use(parse[, options])&#x60;

Configure the &#x60;processor&#x60; to read markdown as input and process
[**mdast**][mdast] syntax trees.

##### &#x60;options&#x60;

Options are passed directly, or passed later through [&#x60;processor.data()&#x60;][data].

##### &#x60;options.gfm&#x60;

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;md
hello ~~hi~~ world
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

GFM mode (&#x60;boolean&#x60;, default: &#x60;true&#x60;) turns on:

*   [Fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks)
*   [Autolinking of URLs](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#url-autolinking)
*   [Deletions (strikethrough)](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#strikethrough)
*   [Task lists](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/#task-lists)
*   [Tables](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#tables)

##### &#x60;options.commonmark&#x60;

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;md
This is a paragraph
    and this is also part of the preceding paragraph.
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

CommonMark mode (&#x60;boolean&#x60;, default: &#x60;false&#x60;) allows:

*   Empty lines to split blockquotes
*   Parentheses (&#x60;(&#x60; and &#x60;)&#x60;) around for link and image titles
*   Any escaped [ASCII-punctuation][escapes] character
*   Closing parenthesis (&#x60;)&#x60;) as an ordered list marker
*   URL definitions (and footnotes, when enabled) in blockquotes

CommonMark mode disallows:

*   Code directly following a paragraph
*   ATX-headings (&#x60;# Hash headings&#x60;) without spacing after opening hashes
    or and before closing hashes
*   Setext headings (&#x60;Underline headings\n---&#x60;) when following a paragraph
*   Newlines in link and image titles
*   White space in link and image URLs in auto-links (links in brackets,
    &#x60;&#x3C;&#x60; and &#x60;&#x3E;&#x60;)

Something something[^or something?].

And something else[^1].

[^1]: This reference footnote contains a paragraph...

    * ...and a list
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Footnotes mode (&#x60;boolean&#x60;, default: &#x60;false&#x60;) enables reference footnotes and
inline footnotes.  Both are wrapped in square brackets and preceded by a caret
(&#x60;^&#x60;), and can be referenced from inside other footnotes.

##### &#x60;options.blocks&#x60;

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;md
&#x3C;block&#x3E;foo
&#x3C;/block&#x3E;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Blocks (&#x60;Array.&#x3C;string&#x3E;&#x60;, default: list of [block HTML elements][blocks])
exposes let&#x2019;s users define block-level HTML elements.

##### &#x60;options.pedantic&#x60;

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;md
Check out some_file_name.txt
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Pedantic mode (&#x60;boolean&#x60;, default: &#x60;false&#x60;) turns on:

*   Emphasis (&#x60;_alpha_&#x60;) and importance (&#x60;__bravo__&#x60;) with underscores
    in words
*   Unordered lists with different markers (&#x60;*&#x60;, &#x60;-&#x60;, &#x60;+&#x60;)
*   If &#x60;commonmark&#x60; is also turned on, ordered lists with different
    markers (&#x60;.&#x60;, &#x60;)&#x60;)
*   And pedantic mode removes less spaces in list-items (at most four,
    instead of the whole indent)

### &#x60;parse.Parser&#x60;

Access to the [parser][], if you need it.

## Extending the Parser

Most often, using transformers to manipulate a syntax tree produces
the desired output.  Sometimes, mainly when introducing new syntactic
entities with a certain level of precedence, interfacing with the parser
is necessary.

If the &#x60;remark-parse&#x60; plugin is used, it adds a [&#x60;Parser&#x60;][parser] constructor
to the &#x60;processor&#x60;.  Other plugins can add tokenizers to the parser&#x2019;s prototype
to change how markdown is parsed.

The below plugin adds a [tokenizer][] for at-mentions.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
module.exports = mentions

function mentions() {
  var Parser = this.Parser
  var tokenizers = Parser.prototype.inlineTokenizers
  var methods = Parser.prototype.inlineMethods

  // Add an inline tokenizer (defined in the following example).
  tokenizers.mention = tokenizeMention

  // Run it just before &#x60;text&#x60;.
  methods.splice(methods.indexOf(&#x27;text&#x27;), 0, &#x27;mention&#x27;)
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### &#x60;Parser#blockTokenizers&#x60;

An object mapping tokenizer names to [tokenizer][]s.  These
tokenizers (for example: &#x60;fencedCode&#x60;, &#x60;table&#x60;, and &#x60;paragraph&#x60;) eat
from the start of a value to a line ending.

See &#x60;#blockMethods&#x60; below for a list of methods that are included by
default.

### &#x60;Parser#blockMethods&#x60;

Array of &#x60;blockTokenizers&#x60; names (&#x60;string&#x60;) specifying the order in
which they run.

&#x3C;!--methods-block start--&#x3E;

*   &#x60;newline&#x60;
*   &#x60;indentedCode&#x60;
*   &#x60;fencedCode&#x60;
*   &#x60;blockquote&#x60;
*   &#x60;atxHeading&#x60;
*   &#x60;thematicBreak&#x60;
*   &#x60;list&#x60;
*   &#x60;setextHeading&#x60;
*   &#x60;html&#x60;
*   &#x60;footnote&#x60;
*   &#x60;definition&#x60;
*   &#x60;table&#x60;
*   &#x60;paragraph&#x60;

&#x3C;!--methods-block end--&#x3E;

### &#x60;Parser#inlineTokenizers&#x60;

An object mapping tokenizer names to [tokenizer][]s.  These tokenizers
(for example: &#x60;url&#x60;, &#x60;reference&#x60;, and &#x60;emphasis&#x60;) eat from the start
of a value.  To increase performance, they depend on [locator][]s.

See &#x60;#inlineMethods&#x60; below for a list of methods that are included by
default.

### &#x60;Parser#inlineMethods&#x60;

Array of &#x60;inlineTokenizers&#x60; names (&#x60;string&#x60;) specifying the order in
which they run.

&#x3C;!--methods-inline start--&#x3E;

*   &#x60;escape&#x60;
*   &#x60;autoLink&#x60;
*   &#x60;url&#x60;
*   &#x60;html&#x60;
*   &#x60;link&#x60;
*   &#x60;reference&#x60;
*   &#x60;strong&#x60;
*   &#x60;emphasis&#x60;
*   &#x60;deletion&#x60;
*   &#x60;code&#x60;
*   &#x60;break&#x60;
*   &#x60;text&#x60;

&#x3C;!--methods-inline end--&#x3E;

### &#x60;function tokenizer(eat, value, silent)&#x60;

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
tokenizeMention.notInLink = true
tokenizeMention.locator = locateMention

function tokenizeMention(eat, value, silent) {
  var match = /^@(\w+)/.exec(value)

  if (match) {
    if (silent) {
      return true
    }

    return eat(match[0])({
      type: &#x27;link&#x27;,
      url: &#x27;https://social-network/&#x27; + match[1],
      children: [{type: &#x27;text&#x27;, value: match[0]}]
    })
  }
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

The parser knows two types of tokenizers: block level and inline level.
Block level tokenizers are the same as inline level tokenizers, with
the exception that the latter must have a [locator][].

Tokenizers _test_ whether a document starts with a certain syntactic
entity.  In _silent_ mode, they return whether that test passes.
In _normal_ mode, they consume that token, a process which is called
&#x201C;eating&#x201D;.  Locators enable tokenizers to function faster by providing
information on where the next entity may occur.

###### Signatures

*   &#x60;Node? = tokenizer(eat, value)&#x60;
*   &#x60;boolean? = tokenizer(eat, value, silent)&#x60;

###### Parameters

*   &#x60;eat&#x60; ([&#x60;Function&#x60;][eat]) &#x2014; Eat, when applicable, an entity
*   &#x60;value&#x60; (&#x60;string&#x60;) &#x2014; Value which may start an entity
*   &#x60;silent&#x60; (&#x60;boolean&#x60;, optional) &#x2014; Whether to detect or consume

###### Properties

*   &#x60;locator&#x60; ([&#x60;Function&#x60;][locator])
    &#x2014; Required for inline tokenizers
*   &#x60;onlyAtStart&#x60; (&#x60;boolean&#x60;)
    &#x2014; Whether nodes can only be found at the beginning of the document
*   &#x60;notInBlock&#x60; (&#x60;boolean&#x60;)
    &#x2014; Whether nodes cannot be in blockquotes, lists, or footnote
    definitions
*   &#x60;notInList&#x60; (&#x60;boolean&#x60;)
    &#x2014; Whether nodes cannot be in lists
*   &#x60;notInLink&#x60; (&#x60;boolean&#x60;)
    &#x2014; Whether nodes cannot be in links

###### Returns

*   In _silent_ mode, whether a node can be found at the start of &#x60;value&#x60;
*   In _normal_ mode, a node if it can be found at the start of &#x60;value&#x60;

### &#x60;tokenizer.locator(value, fromIndex)&#x60;

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
function locateMention(value, fromIndex) {
  return value.indexOf(&#x27;@&#x27;, fromIndex)
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Locators are required for inline tokenization to keep the process
performant.  Locators enable inline tokenizers to function faster by
providing information on the where the next entity occurs.  Locators
may be wrong, it&#x2019;s OK if there actually isn&#x2019;t a node to be found at
the index they return, but they must skip any nodes.

###### Parameters

*   &#x60;value&#x60; (&#x60;string&#x60;) &#x2014; Value which may contain an entity
*   &#x60;fromIndex&#x60; (&#x60;number&#x60;) &#x2014; Position to start searching at

###### Returns

Index at which an entity may start, and &#x60;-1&#x60; otherwise.

### &#x60;eat(subvalue)&#x60;

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var add = eat(&#x27;foo&#x27;)
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Eat &#x60;subvalue&#x60;, which is a string at the start of the
[tokenize][tokenizer]d &#x60;value&#x60; (it&#x2019;s tracked to ensure the correct
value is eaten).

###### Parameters

*   &#x60;subvalue&#x60; (&#x60;string&#x60;) - Value to eat.

###### Returns

[&#x60;add&#x60;][add].

### &#x60;add(node[, parent])&#x60;

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var add = eat(&#x27;foo&#x27;)

add({type: &#x27;text&#x27;, value: &#x27;foo&#x27;})
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Add [positional information][location] to &#x60;node&#x60; and add it to &#x60;parent&#x60;.

###### Parameters

*   &#x60;node&#x60; ([&#x60;Node&#x60;][node]) - Node to patch position on and insert
*   &#x60;parent&#x60; ([&#x60;Node&#x60;][node], optional) - Place to add &#x60;node&#x60; to in
    the syntax tree.  Defaults to the currently processed node

###### Returns

The given &#x60;node&#x60;.

### &#x60;add.test()&#x60;

Get the [positional information][location] which would be patched on
&#x60;node&#x60; by &#x60;add&#x60;.

###### Returns

[&#x60;Location&#x60;][location].

### &#x60;add.reset(node[, parent])&#x60;

&#x60;add&#x60;, but resets the internal location.  Useful for example in
lists, where the same content is first eaten for a list, and later
for list items

###### Parameters

*   &#x60;node&#x60; ([&#x60;Node&#x60;][node]) - Node to patch position on and insert
*   &#x60;parent&#x60; ([&#x60;Node&#x60;][node], optional) - Place to add &#x60;node&#x60; to in
    the syntax tree.  Defaults to the currently processed node

###### Returns

The given &#x60;node&#x60;.

### Turning off a tokenizer

In rare situations, you may want to turn off a tokenizer to avoid parsing
that syntactic feature.  This can be done by replacing the tokenizer from
your Parser&#x2019;s &#x60;blockTokenizers&#x60; (or &#x60;blockMethods&#x60;) or &#x60;inlineTokenizers&#x60;
(or &#x60;inlineMethods&#x60;).

The following example turns off indented code blocks:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
remarkParse.Parser.prototype.blockTokenizers.indentedCode = indentedCode

function indentedCode() {
  return true
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Preferably, just use [this plugin](https://github.com/zestedesavoir/zmarkdown/tree/master/packages/remark-disable-tokenizers).

### &#x60;stringify.Compiler&#x60;

Access to the raw [compiler][], if you need it.

## Extending the Compiler

If this plugin is used, it adds a [&#x60;Compiler&#x60;][compiler] constructor
to the &#x60;processor&#x60;.  Other plugins can change and add visitors on
the compiler&#x2019;s prototype to change how markdown is stringified.

The below plugin modifies a [visitor][] to add an extra blank line
before level two headings.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
module.exports = gap

function gap() {
  var Compiler = this.Compiler
  var visitors = Compiler.prototype.visitors
  var original = visitors.heading

  visitors.heading = heading

  function heading(node) {
    return (node.depth === 2 ? &#x27;\n&#x27; : &#x27;&#x27;) + original.apply(this, arguments)
  }
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### &#x60;Compiler#visitors&#x60;

An object mapping [node][] types to [&#x60;visitor&#x60;][visitor]s.

### &#x60;function visitor(node[, parent])&#x60;

Stringify &#x60;node&#x60;.

###### Parameters

*   &#x60;node&#x60; ([&#x60;Node&#x60;][node]) &#x2014; Node to compile
*   &#x60;parent&#x60; ([&#x60;Node&#x60;][node], optional) &#x2014; Parent of &#x60;node&#x60;

###### Returns

&#x60;string&#x60;, the compiled given &#x60;node&#x60;.

## Usage

###### Common example

This example lints markdown and turns it into HTML.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var remark = require(&#x27;remark&#x27;)
var recommended = require(&#x27;remark-preset-lint-recommended&#x27;)
var html = require(&#x27;remark-html&#x27;)
var report = require(&#x27;vfile-reporter&#x27;)

remark()
  .use(recommended)
  .use(html)
  .process(&#x27;## Hello world!&#x27;, function(err, file) {
    console.error(report(err || file))
    console.log(String(file))
  })
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Yields:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;txt

&#x22;Contribution&#x22; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

&#x22;Contributor&#x22; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#x22;AS IS&#x22; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">run-queue</a></h4><pre class="hidden"># run-queue

A promise based, dynamic priority queue runner, with concurrency limiting.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const RunQueue = require(&#x27;run-queue&#x27;)

const queue = new RunQueue({
  maxConcurrency: 1
})

queue.add(1, example, [-1])
for (let ii = 0; ii &#x3C; 5; ++ii) {
  queue.add(0, example, [ii])
}
const finished = []
queue.run().then(
  console.log(finished)
})

function example (num, next) {
  setTimeout(() =&#x3E; {
    finished.push(num)
    next()
  }, 5 - Math.abs(num))
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

would output

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1 ]
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

If you bump concurrency to &#x60;2&#x60;, then you get:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
[ 1, 0, 3, 2, 4, -1 ]
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

The concurrency means that they don&#x27;t finish in order, because some take
longer than others.  Each priority level must finish entirely before the
next priority level is run.  See
[PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is
even true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue
can execute at once, for instance, with &#x60;maxConcurrency: 10&#x60;:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
[ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ]
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## API

### const queue = new RunQueue(options)

Create a new queue. Options may contain:

* maxConcurrency - (Default: &#x60;1&#x60;) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once.
* Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.

### queue.add (prio, fn, args)

Add a new job to the end of the queue at priority &#x60;prio&#x60; that will run &#x60;fn&#x60;
with &#x60;args&#x60;. If &#x60;fn&#x60; is async then it should return a Promise.

### queue.run ()

Start running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either
all the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a
rejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected
with that error and no further queue running will be done.

## PRIORITIES

Priorities are any integer value &#x3E;= 0.

Lowest is executed first.

Priorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue
must complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.

This means that if you have two queues, &#x60;0&#x60; and &#x60;1&#x60; then ALL jobs in &#x60;0&#x60;
must complete before ANY execute in &#x60;1&#x60;.  If you add new &#x60;0&#x60; level jobs
while &#x60;1&#x60; level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the &#x60;0&#x60;
queue and won&#x27;t execute any more &#x60;1&#x60; jobs till all of the new &#x60;0&#x60; jobs
complete.

    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be

    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

&#x3E; Convert Windows backslash paths to slash paths: &#x60;foo\\bar&#x60; &#x2794; &#x60;foo/bar&#x60;

[Forward-slash paths can be used in Windows](http://superuser.com/a/176395/6877) as long as they&#x27;re not extended-length paths and don&#x27;t contain any non-ascii characters.

This was created since the &#x60;path&#x60; methods in Node outputs &#x60;\\&#x60; paths on Windows.


## Install

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;sh
$ npm install --save slash
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;


## Usage

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var path = require(&#x27;path&#x27;);
var slash = require(&#x27;slash&#x27;);

var str = path.join(&#x27;foo&#x27;, &#x27;bar&#x27;);
// Unix    =&#x3E; foo/bar
// Windows =&#x3E; foo\\bar

slash(str);
// Unix    =&#x3E; foo/bar
// Windows =&#x3E; foo/bar
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;


## API

### slash(path)

Type: &#x60;string&#x60;

Accepts a Windows backslash path and returns a slash path.

      &#x22;control&#x22; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      &#x22;You&#x22; (or &#x22;Your&#x22;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      &#x22;Source&#x22; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      &#x22;Object&#x22; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &#x22;Work&#x22; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &#x22;Derivative Works&#x22; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &#x22;Contribution&#x22; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &#x22;submitted&#x22;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &#x22;Not a Contribution.&#x22;

      &#x22;Contributor&#x22; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &#x22;NOTICE&#x22; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#x22;AS IS&#x22; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">stable</a></h4><pre class="hidden">## Stable

A stable array sort, because &#x60;Array#sort()&#x60; is not guaranteed stable.

MIT licensed.

[![Node.js CI](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable)

[![Browser CI](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable)

#### From npm

Install with:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;sh
npm install stable
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Then use it in Node.js or some other CommonJS environment as:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const stable = require(&#x27;stable&#x27;)
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

#### From the browser

Include [&#x60;stable.js&#x60;] or the minified version [&#x60;stable.min.js&#x60;]
in your page, then call &#x60;stable()&#x60;.

 [&#x60;stable.js&#x60;]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.js
 [&#x60;stable.min.js&#x60;]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.min.js

#### Usage

The default sort is, as with &#x60;Array#sort&#x60;, lexicographical:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
stable([&#x27;foo&#x27;, &#x27;bar&#x27;, &#x27;baz&#x27;])  // =&#x3E; [&#x27;bar&#x27;, &#x27;baz&#x27;, &#x27;foo&#x27;]
stable([10, 1, 5])             // =&#x3E; [1, 10, 5]
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Unlike &#x60;Array#sort&#x60;, the default sort is **NOT** in-place. To do an in-place
sort, use &#x60;stable.inplace&#x60;, which otherwise works the same:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const arr = [10, 1, 5]
stable(arr) === arr          // =&#x3E; false
stable.inplace(arr) === arr  // =&#x3E; true
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

A comparator function can be specified:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
// Regular sort() compatible comparator, that returns a number.
// This demonstrates the default behavior.
const lexCmp = (a, b) =&#x3E; String(a).localeCompare(b)
stable([&#x27;foo&#x27;, &#x27;bar&#x27;, &#x27;baz&#x27;], lexCmp)  // =&#x3E; [&#x27;bar&#x27;, &#x27;baz&#x27;, &#x27;foo&#x27;]

// Boolean comparator. Sorts &#x60;b&#x60; before &#x60;a&#x60; if true.
// This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically.

## Documentation
The main store function can handle &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;set&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;, &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;get&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;, &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;transact&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;, &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;setAll&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;, &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;getAll&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;, &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;each&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;, and &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;clear&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
actions directly. Respectively, these are called like so:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
store(key, data);                 // sets stringified data under key
store(key);                       // gets and parses data stored under key
store(key, fn[, alt]);            // run transaction function on/with data stored under key
store({key: data, key2: data2});  // sets all key/data pairs in the object
store();                          // gets all stored key/data pairs as an object
store((key, data)=&#x3E;{ });          // calls function for each key/data in storage, return false to exit
store(false);                     // clears all items from storage
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Parameters in [brackets] are optional. There are also more explicit and versatile functions available:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
store.set(key, data[, overwrite]); // === store(key, data);
store.setAll(data[, overwrite]);   // === store({key: data, key2: data});
store.get(key[, alt]);             // === store(key);
store.getAll([fillObj]);           // === store();
store.transact(key, fn[, alt]);    // === store(key, fn[, alt]);
store.clear();                     // === store(false);
store.has(key);                    // returns true or false
store.remove(key[, alt]);          // removes key and its data, then returns the data or alt, if none
store.each(fn[, fill]);            // === store(fn); optional call arg will be 3rd fn arg (e.g. for gathering values)
store.add(key, data);              // concats, merges, or adds new value into existing one
store.keys([fillList]);            // returns array of keys
store.size();                      // number of keys, not length of data
store.clearAll();                  // clears *ALL* areas (but still namespace sensitive)
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Passing in &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;false&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; for the optional overwrite parameters will cause &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;set&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; actions to be skipped 
if the storage already has a value for that key. All &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;set&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; action methods return the previous value 
for that key, by default. If overwrite is &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;false&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; and there is a previous value, the unused new 
value will be returned.

All functions which take an optional &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;alt&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; parameter can also use that parameter to specify a &#x22;reviver&#x22; function. These receive each key and value (yes, nested ones too) as arguments and allow you to provide an alternate means of parsing that string. This is particularly useful for rich objects like &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;Date&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; types. See [MDN&#x27;s JSON.parse docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) for more information and examples. Alternately, you can set a global reviver to the &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store._.revive&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; property to handle all &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;get&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;, &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;getAll&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;, and &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;transact&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; calls.

Functions passed to &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;transact&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; will receive the current value for that key as an argument or
a passed alternate if there is none. When the passed function is completed, transact will save the returned value
under the specified key. If the function returns &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;undefined&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;, the original value will be saved.
This makes it easy for transact functions to change internal properties in a persistent way:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
store.transact(key, function(obj) {
    obj.changed = &#x27;newValue&#x27;;// this change will be persisted
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Functions passed to &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;each&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; will receive the key as first argument and current value as the second; if a &#x60;fill&#x60; parameter is specified, it&#x27;s value will be the third argument for every call (few should ever
need a &#x60;fill&#x60; parameter). If the function returns &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;false&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; at any point during the iteration, the
loop will exit early and not continue on to the next key/value pair.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
store.each(function(key, value) {
    console.log(key, &#x27;-&#x3E;&#x27;, value);
    if (key === &#x27;stopLoop&#x27;) {
        return false;// this will cause each to stop calling this function
    }
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

For &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;getAll&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; and &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;keys&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;, there is the option to pass in the object or list, respectively,
that you want the results to be added to. This is instead of an empty list.
There are only a few special cases where you are likely to need or want this,
in general, most users should ignore these optional parameters.
These both use the  second, optional argument &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;each&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; function,
which is also a niche feature. The &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;value&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; argument is passed as
the second arg to the callback function (in place of the data associated with the current key)
and is returned at the end. Again, most users should not need this feature.
All of these use the browser&#x27;s localStorage (aka &#x22;local&#x22;). Using sessionStorage merely requires 
calling the same functions on &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store.session&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
store.session(&#x22;addMeTo&#x22;, &#x22;sessionStorage&#x22;);
store.local({lots: &#x27;of&#x27;, data: &#x27;altogether&#x27;});// store.local === store :)
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
There is also a store API automatically available for keeping non-persistent information,
meant only to last until page reload.
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
store.page(&#x22;until&#x22;,&#x22;reload&#x22;);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

All the specific &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;get&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;, &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;set&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;, etc. functions are available on &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store.session&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;, &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store.local&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;, and &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store.page&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;, as well as any other storage facility registered via &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store.area(name, customStorageObject)&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; by an extension, where customStorageObject must implement the [Storage interface][storage]. This is how [store.old.js][old] extends store.js to support older versions of IE and Firefox.

[storage]: http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/#the-storage-interface

If you want to put stored data from different pages or areas of your site into separate namespaces, 
the &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store.namespace(ns)&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; function is your friend:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
var cart = store.namespace(&#x27;cart&#x27;);
cart(&#x27;total&#x27;, 23.25);// stores in localStorage as &#x27;cart.total&#x27;
console.log(store(&#x27;cart.total&#x27;) == cart(&#x27;total&#x27;));// logs true
console.log(store.cart.getAll());// logs {total: 23.25}
cart.session(&#x27;group&#x27;, &#x27;toys&#x27;);// stores in sessionStorage as &#x27;cart.group&#x27;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

The namespace provides the same exact API as &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; but silently adds/removes the namespace prefix as needed.
It also makes the namespaced API accessible directly via &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store[namespace]&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (e.g. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store.cart&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;) as long as it
does not conflict with an existing part of the store API.

The &#x27;namespace&#x27; function is one of two &#x22;extra&#x22; functions that are also part of the &#x22;store API&#x22;:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
store.namespace(prefix);// returns a new store API that prefixes all key-based functions
store.isFake();// is this actually localStorage/sessionStorage or an in-memory fallback?
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

If localStorage or sessionStorage are unavailable, they will be faked to prevent errors,
but data stored will NOT persist beyond the life of the current document/page. Use the 
[store.old.js][old] extension to add persistent backing for the store API in ancient browsers.

## Extensions
These mostly could use further documentation and abuse...er...testing.
Contributions are welcome!
In particular, any ES6 user interested in making these [importable in ES6][es6importissue] would be appreciated.

[es6importissue]: https://github.com/nbubna/store/issues/31

#### Beta - Stable and definitely useful
* [store.old.js][old] - Add working localStorage and sessionStorage polyfills for ancient browsers
* [store.overflow.js][overflow] - Fall back to fake storage on quota errors
* [store.cache.js][cache] - To make data expire, pass a number of seconds as the overwrite (third) param on &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;set()&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; calls
* [store.on.js][on] - Superior storage event handling (per key, per namespace, etc in IE9+)
* [store.array.js][array] - Easy, powerful array functions for any and all data (e.g. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store.push(key, v1, v2)&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;).
* [store.dom.js][dom] - Declarative, persistent DOM element content via store.

#### Alpha - Either incomplete or unstable or both
* [store.quota.js][quota] - Register callbacks to handle (and even cancel) quota errors
* [store.measure.js][measure] - Experimental extension for measuring space used and available (needs work)
* [store.onlyreal.js][onlyreal] - When only fake storage is available, silently fail instead of faking it.
* [store.dot.js][dot] - Creates accessors for keys (e.g. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store.foo == store.get(&#x27;foo&#x27;)&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;)
* [store.deep.js][deep] - Allow retrieval of properties from within stored objects (e.g. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store.get(&#x27;key.property&#x27;)&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;)
* [store.async.js][async] - Adds &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store.async&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; duplicate to each store and namespace that performs functions asynchronously and returns a Promise that resolves when complete.

#### Write Your Own Extension
To write your own extension, you can use or carefully override internal functions exposed as &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store._&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;.
In particular, the &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store._.fn(fnName, fn)&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; method is available to automatically add your new function
to every instance of the &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; interface (e.g. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;, &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;store.session&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
and all existing and future namespaces). Take care using this, as it will override existing methods.
Here is a simple example:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
(function(_) {
    _.fn(&#x27;falsy&#x27;, function(key) {
        return !this.get(key);
    });
    _.fn(&#x27;truthy&#x27;, function(key) {
        return !this.falsy(key);
    });
})(store._);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
This extension would be used like so:
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript
store(&#x27;foo&#x27;, 1);
store.falsy(&#x27;foo&#x27;); // returns false

store.session(&#x27;bar&#x27;, &#x27;one&#x27;);
store.session.truthy(&#x27;bar&#x27;); // return true;

const widgetStore = store.namespace(&#x27;widget&#x27;);
widgetStore.falsy(&#x27;state&#x27;); // returns true
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      &#x22;License&#x22; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      &#x22;Licensor&#x22; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      &#x22;Legal Entity&#x22; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      &#x22;control&#x22; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      &#x22;You&#x22; (or &#x22;Your&#x22;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      &#x22;Source&#x22; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      &#x22;Object&#x22; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &#x22;Work&#x22; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &#x22;Derivative Works&#x22; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &#x22;Contribution&#x22; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &#x22;submitted&#x22;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &#x22;Not a Contribution.&#x22;

      &#x22;Contributor&#x22; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &#x22;NOTICE&#x22; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#x22;AS IS&#x22; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">telejson</a></h4><pre class="hidden"># TeleJSON

A library for teleporting rich data to another place.

## Install

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;sh
yarn add telejson
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## What can it do, what can&#x27;t it do:

&#x60;JSON.parse&#x60; &#x26; &#x60;JSON.stringify&#x60; have limitation by design, because there are no data formats for things like
- Date
- Function
- Class
- Symbol
- etc.

Also JSON doesn&#x27;t support cyclic data structures.

This library allows you to pass in data with all all the above properties.
It will transform the properties to something that&#x27;s allowed by the JSON spec whilst stringifying,
and then convert back to the cyclic data structure when parsing.

When parsing, **class instances** will be given the Class&#x27;s name again.
The prototype isn&#x27;t copied over.

**Functions** are supported, they are stringified and will be eval-ed when called. 
This lazy eval is important for performance.
The eval happens via &#x60;eval()&#x60;
Functions are stripped of comments and whitespace.

&#x3E; Obviously calling the function will only really work as expected if the functions were pure the begin with.

**Regular expressions** just work.

**Symbol** will be re-created with the same string. (resulting in a similar, but different symbol)

**Dates** are parsed back into actual Date objects.

## API

You have 2 choices:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import { stringify, parse } from &#x27;telejson&#x27;;

const Foo = function(){};

const root = {
  date: new Date(&#x27;2018&#x27;),
  regex1: /foo/,
  regex2: /foo/g,
  regex2: new RegExp(&#x27;foo&#x27;,&#x27;i&#x27;),
  fn1: () =&#x3E; &#x27;foo&#x27;,
  fn2: function fn2() { return &#x27;foo&#x27;; },
  Foo: new Foo(),
};

// something cyclic
root.root = root;

const stringified = stringify(root);
const parsed = parse(stringified);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

stringify and parse do not conform to the JSON.stringify or JSON.parse api.
they take an data object and a option object.

OR you can use use the &#x60;replacer&#x60; and &#x60;reviver&#x60;:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import { replacer, reviver } from &#x27;telejson&#x27;;
import data from &#x27;somewhere&#x27;;

const stringified = JSON.stringify(data, reviver(), 2);
const parsed = JSON.parse(stringified, reviver(), 2);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

notice that both replacer and reviver need to be called! doing the following will NOT WORK:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
const stringified = JSON.stringify(data, reviver, 2);
const parsed = JSON.parse(stringified, reviver, 2);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## options

You either pass the options-object to &#x60;replacer&#x60; or as a second argument to &#x60;stringify&#x60;:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
replacer({ maxDepth: 10 });
stringify(date, { maxDepth: 10 });
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

### replacer

&#x60;maxDepth&#x60;: controls how deep to keep stringifying. When max depth is reach, 
objects will be replaced with &#x60;&#x22;[Object]&#x22;&#x60;, arrays will be replaced with &#x60;&#x22;[Array(&#x3C;length&#x3E;)]&#x22;&#x60;.
default value is &#x60;10&#x60;
This option is really useful if your object is huge/complex, and you don&#x27;t care about the deeply nested data.

&#x60;space&#x60;: controls how to prettify the output string.
default value is &#x60;undefined&#x60;, no white space is used.
Only relevant when using &#x60;stringify&#x60;.

&#x60;allowFunction&#x60;: When set to false, functions will not be serialized. (default = true)

&#x60;allowRegExp&#x60;: When set to false, regular expressions will not be serialized. (default = true)

&#x60;allowClass&#x60;: When set to false, class instances will not be serialized. (default = true)

&#x60;allowDate&#x60;: When set to false, Date objects will not be serialized. (default = true)

&#x60;allowUndefined&#x60;: When set to false, &#x60;undefined&#x60; will not be serialized. (default = true)

&#x60;allowSymbol&#x60;: When set to false, Symbols will not be serialized. (default = true)

### reviver

&#x60;lazyEval&#x60;: When set to false, lazy eval will be disabled. (default true)

Note: disabling lazy eval will affect performance. Consider disabling it only if you truly need to.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation&#x27;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author&#x27;s protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors&#x27; reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone&#x27;s free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &#x22;Program&#x22;, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &#x22;work based on the Program&#x22;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term &#x22;modification&#x22;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &#x22;you&#x22;.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#x27;s
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients&#x27; exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &#x22;any
later version&#x22;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &#x22;AS IS&#x22; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Truncate a string to the given length in bytes. Correctly handles
multi-byte characters and surrogate pairs.

A browser implementation that doesn&#x27;t use &#x60;Buffer.byteLength&#x60; is
provided to minimize build size.

## Example

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var truncate = require(&#x22;truncate-utf8-bytes&#x22;)
var str = &#x22;a&#x2603;&#x22; // a = 1 byte, &#x2603; = 3 bytes
console.log(truncate(str, 2))
// -&#x3E; &#x22;a&#x22;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## API

### &#x60;var truncate = require(&#x22;truncate-utf8-bytes&#x22;)&#x60;

*When using browserify or webpack*, this automatically resolves to an
implementation that does not use &#x60;Buffer.byteLength&#x60;.

### &#x60;truncate(string, length)&#x60;

Returns &#x60;string&#x60; truncated to at most &#x60;length&#x60; bytes in length.

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ts-pnp.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-pnp)
[![node version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/ts-pnp.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-pnp)

*This plugin is also available for Webpack ([pnp-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin)), Jest ([jest-pnp-resolver](https://github.com/arcanis/jest-pnp-resolver)), and Rollup ([rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve](https://github.com/arcanis/rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve))*

## Installation

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
yarn add -D ts-pnp
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## Usage

*Note that &#x60;ts-pnp&#x60; is a low-level package - you shouldn&#x27;t have to use it unless you&#x27;re writing a TS compiler host. If you just want to write TypeScript and have it Just Work&#x2122;, take a look at [&#x60;pnp-webpack-plugin&#x60;](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin#ts-loader-integration) instead.*

This package exports a function that can be used to implement the [&#x60;resolveModuleName&#x60; hook from &#x60;CompilerHost&#x60;](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API#customizing-module-resolution). It mimics the interface from the one you&#x27;d typically use and, as all other PnP plugins, works just fine whether your application is actually running under PnP or not.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import {resolveModuleName} from &#x27;ts-pnp&#x27;;
import * as ts from &#x27;typescript&#x27;;

function createCompilerHost(
  compilerOptions: ts.CompilerOptions,
): ts.CompilerHost {
  const compilerHost = {
    resolveModuleNames,
    resolveTypeReferenceDirectives,
  };

  return compilerHost;

  function resolveModuleNames(moduleNames: string[], containingFile: string) {
    return moduleNames.map(moduleName =&#x3E; {
      return resolveModuleName(moduleName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveModuleName).resolvedModule;
    });
  }

  function resolveTypeReferenceDirectives(typeDirectiveNames: string[], containingFile: string) {
    return typeDirectiveNames.map(typeDirectiveName =&#x3E; {
      return resolveModuleName(typeDirectiveName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveTypeReferenceDirective).resolvedTypeReferenceDirective;
    });
  }
}

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

&#x22;Work&#x22; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

&#x22;Derivative Works&#x22; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

&#x22;Contribution&#x22; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &#x22;submitted&#x22; means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as &#x22;Not a Contribution.&#x22;

&#x22;Contributor&#x22; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a &#x22;NOTICE&#x22; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#x22;AS IS&#x22; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

---

&#x3E; Keep in mind that useRef doesn&#x27;t notify you when its content changes.
Mutating the .current property doesn&#x27;t cause a re-render.
If you want to run some code when React attaches or detaches a ref to a DOM node, 
you may want to use ~~a callback ref instead~~ .... __useCallbackRef__ instead.

&#x2013; [Hooks API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref)

Read more about &#x60;use-callback&#x60; pattern and use cases: 
- https://dev.to/thekashey/the-same-useref-but-it-will-callback-8bo


This library exposes helpers to handle any case related to &#x60;ref&#x60; _lifecycle_

- &#x60;useCallbackRef&#x60; - react on hook change
- &#x60;mergeRefs&#x60; - merge multiple refs together. For, actually, fork
- &#x60;transformRef&#x60; - transform one ref to anther
- &#x60;refToCallback&#x60; - convert RefObject to an old callback-style ref
- &#x60;assignRef&#x60; - assign value to the ref, regardless of it&#x27;s form

All functions are tree shakable, but even together it&#x27;s __less then 300b__.

# API
&#x1F4A1; Some commands are hooks based, and returns the same refs/functions every render. 
But some are not, to be used in classes or non-react code.

## useRef API
&#x1F914; Use case: every time you have to react to ref change

API is 99% compatible with React &#x60;createRef&#x60; and &#x60;useRef&#x60;, and just adds another argument - &#x60;callback&#x60;,
which would be called on __ref update__.

#### createCallbackRef - to replace React.createRef
- &#x60;createCallbackRef(callback)&#x60; -  would call provided &#x60;callback&#x60; when ref is changed.

#### useCallbackRef - to replace React.useRef
- &#x60;useCallbackRef(initialValue, callback)&#x60; - would call provided &#x60;callback&#x60; when ref is changed.

&#x3E; &#x60;callback&#x60; in both cases is &#x60;callback(newValue, oldValue)&#x60;. Callback would not be called if newValue and oldValue is the same.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import {useRef, createRef, useState} from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import {useCallbackRef, createCallbackRef} from &#x27;use-callback-ref&#x27;;

const Component = () =&#x3E; {
  const [,forceUpdate] = useState();
  // I dont need callback when ref changes
  const ref = useRef(null); 
  
  // but sometimes - it could be what you need
  const anotherRef = useCallbackRef(null, () =&#x3E; forceUpdate());
  
  useEffect( () =&#x3E; {
    // now it&#x27;s just possible
  }, [anotherRef.current]) // react to dom node change
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

&#x1F4A1; You can use &#x60;useCallbackRef&#x60; to convert RefObject into RefCallback, creating bridges between the old and the new code
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
// some old component
const onRefUpdate = (newValue) =&#x3E; {...}
const refObject = useCallbackRef(null, onRefUpdate);
// ...
&#x3C;SomeNewComponent ref={refObject}/&#x3E;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## assignRef
&#x1F914; Use case: every time you need to assign ref manually, and you dont know the shape of the ref

&#x60;assignRef(ref, value)&#x60; - assigns &#x60;values&#x60; to the &#x60;ref&#x60;. &#x60;ref&#x60; could be RefObject or RefCallback.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
&#x1F6AB; ref.current = value // what if it&#x27;s a callback-ref?
&#x1F6AB; ref(value) // but what if it&#x27;s a object ref?

import {assignRef} from &#x22;use-callback-ref&#x22;;
&#x2705; assignRef(ref, value); 
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## useTransformRef (to replace React.useImperativeHandle)
&#x1F914; Use case: ref could be different. 
&#x60;transformRef(ref, tranformer):Ref&#x60; - return a new &#x60;ref&#x60; which would propagate all changes to the provided &#x60;ref&#x60; with applied &#x60;transform&#x60;

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
// before
const ResizableWithRef = forwardRef((props, ref) =&#x3E;
  &#x3C;Resizable {...props} ref={i =&#x3E; i &#x26;&#x26; ref(i.resizable)}/&#x3E;
);

// after

const ResizableWithRef = forwardRef((props, ref) =&#x3E;
  &#x3C;Resizable {...props} ref={transformRef(ref, i =&#x3E; i ? i.resizable : null)}/&#x3E;
);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## refToCallback
&#x60;refToCallback(ref: RefObject): RefCallback&#x60; - for compatibility between the old and the new code.
For the compatibility between &#x60;RefCallback&#x60; and RefObject use &#x60;useCallbackRef(undefined, callback)&#x60; 

## useMergeRefs
&#x60;mergeRefs(refs: arrayOfRefs, [defaultValue]):ReactMutableRef&#x60; - merges a few refs together

When developing low level UI components, it is common to have to use a local ref but also support an external one using React.forwardRef. Natively, React does not offer a way to set two refs inside the ref property. This is the goal of this small utility.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import React from &#x27;react&#x27;
import {useMergeRefs} from &#x27;use-callback-ref&#x27;

const MergedComponent = React.forwardRef((props, ref) =&#x3E; {
  const localRef = React.useRef();
  // ...
  // both localRef and ref would be populated with the &#x60;ref&#x60; to a &#x60;div&#x60;
  return &#x3C;div ref={useMergeRefs([localRef, ref])} /&#x3E;
})
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## mergeRefs 
&#x60;mergeRefs(refs: arrayOfRefs, [defaultValue]):ReactMutableRef&#x60; - merges a few refs together
is a non-hook based version. Will produce the new &#x60;ref&#x60; every run, causing the old one to unmount, and be _populated_ with the &#x60;null&#x60; value.

&#x3E; mergeRefs are based on https://github.com/smooth-code/react-merge-refs, just exposes a RefObject, instead of a callback

&#x60;mergeRefs&#x60; are &#x22;safe&#x22; to use as a part of other hooks-based commands, but don&#x27;t forget - it returns a new object every call. 

## Is it a rocket science?

No, &#x60;RefObject&#x60; is no more than &#x60;{current: ref}&#x60;, and &#x60;use-callback-ref&#x60; is no more than &#x60;getter&#x60; and &#x60;setter&#x60; on that field.

  &#x3C;/a&#x3E;   
  &#x3C;br/&#x3E;
&#x3C;/div&#x3E;

UI/Effects code splitting pattern
 - [read the original article](https://dev.to/thekashey/sidecar-for-a-code-splitting-1o8g) to understand concepts behind.
 - [read how Google](https://medium.com/@cramforce/designing-very-large-javascript-applications-6e013a3291a3) split view and logic.
 - [watch how Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/videos/2019/building-the-new-facebookcom-with-react-graphql-and-relay/) defers &#x22;interactivity&#x22; effects. 

## Terminology: 
- &#x60;sidecar&#x60; - non UI component, which may carry effects for a paired UI component.
- &#x60;UI&#x60; - UI component, which interactivity is moved to a &#x60;sidecar&#x60;.

&#x60;UI&#x60; is a _view_, &#x60;sidecar&#x60; is the _logic_ for it. Like Batman(UI) and his sidekick Robin(effects). 

## Concept
- a &#x60;package&#x60; exposes __3 entry points__ using a [nested &#x60;package.json&#x60; format](https://github.com/theKashey/multiple-entry-points-example):
  - default aka &#x60;combination&#x60;, and lets hope tree shaking will save you
  - &#x60;UI&#x60;, with only UI part
  - &#x60;sidecar&#x60;, with all the logic
  - &#x3E; &#x60;UI&#x60; + &#x60;sidecar&#x60; === &#x60;combination&#x60;. The size of &#x60;UI+sidecar&#x60; might a bit bigger than size of their &#x60;combination&#x60;.
  Use [size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) to control their size independently. 
  

- package uses a &#x60;medium&#x60; to talk with own sidecar, breaking explicit dependency.
 
- if package depends on another _sidecar_ package:
  - it shall export dependency side car among own sidecar.
  - package imports own sidecar via &#x60;medium&#x60;, thus able to export multiple sidecars via one export. 

- final consumer uses &#x60;sidecar&#x60; or &#x60;useSidecar&#x60; to combine pieces together.  

## Rules
- &#x60;UI&#x60; components might use/import any other &#x60;UI&#x60; components
- &#x60;sidecar&#x60; could use/import any other &#x60;sidecar&#x60;

That would form two different code branches, you may load separately - UI first, and effect sidecar later.
That also leads to a obvious consequence - __one sidecar may export all sidecars__.
- to decouple &#x60;sidecars&#x60; from module exports, and be able to pick &#x22;the right&#x22; one at any point
you have to use &#x60;exportSidecar(medium, component)&#x60; to export it, and use the same &#x60;medium&#x60; to import it back.
- this limitation is for __libraries only__, as long as in the usercode you might 
dynamically import whatever and whenever you want. 

- &#x60;useMedium&#x60; is always async - action would be executed in a next tick, or on the logic load.
- &#x60;sidecar&#x60; is always async - is does not matter have you loaded logic or not - component would be 
rendered at least in the next tick.

&#x3E; except &#x60;medium.read&#x60;, which synchronously read the data from a medium, 
and &#x60;medium.assingSyncMedium&#x60; which changes &#x60;useMedium&#x60; to be sync. 

## SSR and usage tracking
Sidecar pattern is clear:
- you dont need to use/render any &#x60;sidecars&#x60; on server.
- you dont have to load &#x60;sidecars&#x60; prior main render.

Thus - no usage tracking, and literally no SSR. It&#x27;s just skipped.


# API

## createMedium()
- Type: Util. Creates shared effect medium for algebraic effect.
- Goal: To decouple modules from each other.
- Usage: &#x60;use&#x60; in UI side, and &#x60;assign&#x60; from side-car. All effects would be executed.
- Analog: WeakMap, React.__SECRET_DOM_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const medium = createMedium(defaultValue);
const cancelCb = medium.useMedium(someData);

// like
useEffect(() =&#x3E; medium.useMedium(someData), []);

medium.assignMedium(someDataProcessor)

// createSidecarMedium is a helper for createMedium to create a &#x22;sidecar&#x22; symbol
const effectCar = createSidecarMedium();
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

&#x3E; ! For consistence &#x60;useMedium&#x60; is async - sidecar load status should not affect function behavior,
thus effect would be always executed at least in the &#x22;next tick&#x22;. You may alter
this behavior by using &#x60;medium.assingSyncMedium&#x60;.


## exportSidecar(medium, component)
- Type: HOC
- Goal: store &#x60;component&#x60; inside &#x60;medium&#x60; and return external wrapper
- Solving: decoupling module exports to support exporting multiple sidecars via a single entry point.
- Usage: use to export a &#x60;sidecar&#x60;
- Analog: WeakMap
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import {effectCar} from &#x27;./medium&#x27;;
import {EffectComponent} from &#x27;./Effect&#x27;;
// !!! - to prevent Effect from being imported
// &#x60;effectCar&#x60; medium __have__ to be defined in another file
// const effectCar = createSidecarMedium();
export default exportSidecar(effectCar, EffectComponent);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## sidecar(importer)
- Type: HOC
- Goal: React.lazy analog for code splitting, but does not require &#x60;Suspense&#x60;, might provide error failback.
- Usage: like React.lazy to load a side-car component.
- Analog: React.Lazy
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import {sidecar} from &#x22;use-sidecar&#x22;;
const Sidecar =  sidecar(() =&#x3E; import(&#x27;./sidecar&#x27;), &#x3C;span&#x3E;on fail&#x3C;/span&#x3E;);

&#x3C;&#x3E;
 &#x3C;Sidecar /&#x3E;
 &#x3C;UI /&#x3E;
&#x3C;/&#x3E; 
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
### Importing &#x60;exportedSidecar&#x60;
Would require additional prop to be set - &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x3C;Sidecar sideCar={effectCar} /&#x3E;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## useSidecar(importer)
- Type: hook, loads a &#x60;sideCar&#x60; using provided &#x60;importer&#x60; which shall follow React.lazy API
- Goal: to load a side car without displaying any &#x22;spinners&#x22;.
- Usage: load side car for a component
- Analog: none
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import {useSidecar} from &#x27;use-sidecar&#x27;;

const [Car, error] = useSidecar(() =&#x3E; import(&#x27;./sideCar&#x27;));
return (
  &#x3C;&#x3E;
    {Car ? &#x3C;Car {...props} /&#x3E; : null}
    &#x3C;UIComponent {...props}&#x3E;
  &#x3C;/&#x3E;
); 
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
### Importing &#x60;exportedSideCar&#x60;
You have to specify __effect medium__ to read data from, as long as __export itself is empty__.
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import {useSidecar} from &#x27;use-sidecar&#x27;;

/* medium.js: */ export const effectCar = useMedium({});
/* sideCar.js: */export default exportSidecar(effectCar, EffectComponent);

const [Car, error] = useSidecar(() =&#x3E; import(&#x27;./sideCar&#x27;), effectCar); 
return (
  &#x3C;&#x3E;
    {Car ? &#x3C;Car {...props} /&#x3E; : null}
    &#x3C;UIComponent {...props}&#x3E;
  &#x3C;/&#x3E;
);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## renderCar(Component)
- Type: HOC, moves renderProp component to a side channel
- Goal: Provide render prop support, ie defer component loading keeping tree untouched.
- Usage: Provide &#x60;defaults&#x60; and use them until sidecar is loaded letting you code split (non visual) render-prop component
- Analog: - Analog: code split library like [react-imported-library](https://github.com/theKashey/react-imported-library) or [@loadable/lib](https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/loadable-components/docs/library-splitting/).
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import {renderCar, sidecar} from &#x22;use-sidecar&#x22;;
const RenderCar = renderCar(
  // will move side car to a side channel
  sidecar(() =&#x3E; import(&#x27;react-powerplug&#x27;).then(imports =&#x3E; imports.Value)),
  // default render props
  [{value: 0}]  
);

&#x3C;RenderCar&#x3E;
  {({value}) =&#x3E; &#x3C;span&#x3E;{value}&#x3C;/span&#x3E;}
&#x3C;/RenderCar&#x3E;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## setConfig(config)
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
setConfig({
  onError, // sets default error handler
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

# Examples
## Deferred effect
Let&#x27;s imagine - on element focus you have to do &#x22;something&#x22;, for example focus anther element

#### Original code
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
onFocus = event =&#x3E; {
  if (event.currentTarget === event.target) {
    document.querySelectorAll(&#x27;button&#x27;, event.currentTarget)
  }
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

#### Sidecar code

3. Use medium (yes, .3)
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
// we are calling medium with an original event as an argument
const onFocus = event =&#x3E; focusMedium.useMedium(event);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
2. Define reaction
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
// in a sidecar

// we are setting handler for the effect medium
// effect is complicated - we are skipping event &#x22;bubbling&#x22;, 
// and focusing some button inside a parent
focusMedium.assignMedium(event =&#x3E; {
  if (event.currentTarget === event.target) {
    document.querySelectorAll(&#x27;button&#x27;, event.currentTarget)
  }
});

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
1. Create medium
Having these constrains - we have to clone &#x60;event&#x60;, as long as React would eventually reuse SyntheticEvent, thus not
preserve &#x60;target&#x60; and &#x60;currentTarget&#x60;. 
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
// 
const focusMedium = createMedium(null, event =&#x3E; ({...event}));
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
Now medium side effect is ok to be async

__Example__: [Effect for react-focus-lock](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock/blob/8c69c644ecfeed2ec9dc0dc4b5b30e896a366738/src/Lock.js#L48) - 1kb UI, 4kb sidecar

### Medium callback
Like a library level code splitting

#### Original code
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
import {x, y} from &#x27;./utils&#x27;;

useEffect(() =&#x3E; {
  if (x()) {
    y()
  }
}, []);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

#### Sidecar code

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
// medium
const utilMedium = createMedium();

// utils
const x = () =&#x3E; { /* ... */};
const y = () =&#x3E; { /* ... */};

// medium will callback with exports exposed
utilMedium.assignMedium(cb =&#x3E; cb({
 x, y
}));


// UI
// not importing x and y from the module system, but would be given via callback
useEffect(() =&#x3E; {
  utilMedium.useMedium(({x,y}) =&#x3E; {
      if (x()) {
        y()
      }
  })
}, []);
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

- Hint: there is a easy way to type it
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const utilMedium = createMedium&#x3C;(cb: typeof import(&#x27;./utils&#x27;)) =&#x3E; void&#x3E;();
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 

__Example__: [Callback API for react-focus-lock](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock/blob/8c69c644ecfeed2ec9dc0dc4b5b30e896a366738/src/MoveFocusInside.js#L12) 

### Split effects
Lets take an example from a Google - Calendar app, with view and logic separated.
To be honest - it&#x27;s not easy to extract logic from application like calendar - usually it&#x27;s tight coupled.

#### Original code
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const CalendarUI = () =&#x3E; { 
  const [date, setDate] = useState();
  const onButtonClick = useCallback(() =&#x3E; setDate(Date.now), []);
  
  return (
    &#x3C;&#x3E;
     &#x3C;input type=&#x22;date&#x22; onChange={setDate} value={date} /&#x3E;
     &#x3C;input type=&#x22;button&#x22; onClick={onButtonClick}&#x3E;Set Today&#x3C;/button&#x3E;
    &#x3C;/&#x3E;
  )
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
#### Sidecar code

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
const CalendarUI = () =&#x3E; {
  const [events, setEvents] = useState({});
  const [date, setDate] = useState();
  
  return (
    &#x3C;&#x3E;
     &#x3C;Sidecar setDate={setDate} setEvents={setEvents}/&#x3E;
     &#x3C;UILayout {...events} date={date}/&#x3E;
    &#x3C;/&#x3E;
  )
}

const UILayout = ({onDateChange, onButtonClick, date}) =&#x3E; (
  &#x3C;&#x3E;
      &#x3C;input type=&#x22;date&#x22; onChange={onDateChange} value={date} /&#x3E;
      &#x3C;input type=&#x22;button&#x22; onClick={onButtonClick}&#x3E;Set Today&#x3C;/button&#x3E;
  &#x3C;/&#x3E;
);

// in a sidecar
// we are providing callbacks back to UI
const Sidecar = ({setDate, setEvents}) =&#x3E; {
  useEffect(() =&#x3E; setEvents({
      onDateChange:setDate,
      onButtonClick: () =&#x3E; setDate(Date.now),
  }), []);
  
  return null;
}
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  

While in this example this looks a bit, you know, strange - there are 3 times more code
that in the original example - that would make a sense for a real Calendar, especially
if some helper library, like &#x60;moment&#x60;, has been used.

__Example__: [Effect for react-remove-scroll](https://github.com/theKashey/react-remove-scroll/blob/666472d5c77fb6c4e5beffdde87c53ae63ef42c5/src/SideEffect.tsx#L166) - 300b UI, 2kb sidecar

</pre><h4><a onClick="toggle(this);">utf8-byte-length</a></h4><pre class="hidden"># utf8-byte-length [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/parshap/utf8-byte-length.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/parshap/utf8-byte-length)

Get the utf8 byte length of a string, taking into account multi-byte
characters and surrogate pairs.

By default, this module defers to &#x60;Buffer.byteLength&#x60;. A browser
implementation is also provided that doesn&#x27;t use &#x60;Buffer.byteLength&#x60;
minimize build size.

## Example

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var getLength = require(&#x22;utf8-byte-length&#x22;)
console.log(truncate(&#x22;a&#x2603;&#x22;, 2)) // a = 1 byte, &#x2603; = 3 bytes
// -&#x3E; 4
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

## API

### &#x60;var getLength = require(&#x22;utf8-byte-length&#x22;)&#x60;

*When using browserify or webpack*, this automatically resolves to an
implementation that does not use &#x60;Buffer.byteLength&#x60;.

### &#x60;getLength(string)&#x60;

Returns the byte length of &#x60;string&#x60;. Throws an error if &#x60;string&#x60; is not
a string.

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &#x22;Not a Contribution.&#x22;

      &#x22;Contributor&#x22; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &#x22;NOTICE&#x22; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#x22;AS IS&#x22; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
